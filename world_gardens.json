        "JGarden Description:": "Visitors to Uji can appreciate the many references in The Tale of Genji to the terrible rushing waters of the Uji River.  Even in its modern and rather tamed incarnation, it still leaves a deep impression as one crosses the long footbridge to reach Byodo-in.This is the former site of the villa of Fujiwara Michinaga (966-1027).  The huge palace was converted to a temple in 1052, but the only surviving building is the Phoenix Hall (Hodo), which was completed in 1053.  The centerpiece of the present site is the impressive Phoenix Hall situated on a small island in a pond.  Little remains of other original garden features.The symmetrical Phoenix Hall is a wonderful example of Heian style architecture, and the importance of this building is attested by its appearance on the back of every ten-yen coin.  It is the oldest surviving building in a Western Paradise style garden.  Western Paradise gardens flourished during the Heian period (785 - 1184), and other famous examples include Ginkaku-ji (the Silver Pavilion) and Kinkaku-ji (the Gold Pavilion) in Kyoto.  Western Paradise gardens are associated with the Jodo, or Pure Land, sect of Buddhism and are dedicated to Amidha Buddha.The building came to be known as the Phoenix Hall during the early Edo period (1603 - 1867) due to its likeness to a phoenix spreading its wings.  The wings of the building serve no practical use and are simply ornamental appendages, but they give the building balance and make it seem firmly situated.  The pond (now much curtailed) which encircles the hall was once a diverted inlet of the Uji River.  The Phoenix Hall itself is a wonder to behold, with its 1,000-year-old wood and vestiges of paint.  The building would originally have been painted orange, and plans are under consideration to restore it.One of the most exciting things about Byodo-in is the recent renovation of the shoreline in front of the Phoenix Hall based on archaeological excavations.  A large-screen video monitor in the new museum shows clips of the work.  When the pond was drained it was found that underneath the crude string of edging rocks and strip of grass which had long fronted the Phoenix Hall, there lay a lovely cobble beach sloping gradually and gracefully into the pond.  The video of the restoration project shows workers laying wafers of clay on the bottom of the pond and pounding stones into it using wooden mallets and sledges.Professor Nakamura Makoto of Kyoto University says archaeological evidence shows that all the grassy banks around the pond were also once similar cobble beaches, but unfortunately funds were not sufficient to complete the renovation all the way around the pond.A fascinating new museum with gardens designed by landscape architect Miyagi Shun includes the original rooftop phoenix ornaments and many other original objects.Although not much remains of the gardens of Byodo-in, the site is imbued with an aura of history.  The sight of the ancient, eastward-facing Phoenix Hall with its elegant skirt of cobble beach grandly reflected in the pond is stunning indeed.",

        "JGarden Description:": "The GardenThe Horai garden at Daichiji is maintained by Shimizu Toshiharu, a priest who teaches social studies at nearby Shirayama Middle School.  His wife is usually the one to show people around, though.  As one walks along the corridors to the viewing pavilion, two things are striking:  the strong smell ofcypress (hinoki)and an odd plunk....plunk....plunk....coming from the loudspeakers attached to the ceiling.  The former is from recent construction work.  On February 2, 1993, a particularly heavy snow caused the roof of the main hall to cave in.  The building has since been entirely rebuilt in cypress to the precise dimensions of the original.  The latter, an acoustic addition to the viewing experience, is an amplified recording of water dropping into asuikinkutsuecho chamber.   The original concept of the garden was also an acoustic one.  The smooth, soft sound of the wind blowing through the pines growing on the site in the 17th century was a reminder of the sea and islands depicted in the garden.The walk along the corridor is short and one soon arrives at Horai Teien.  A massing of shaped green azaleas set against the natural (though constructed) hillside behind and white sand below is the primary feature of the garden.  Marc Treib sees the Horai garden as an example of the juxtaposed modes of formality (shin, gyo, so) that \"have served as a generative force behind much of Japanese art and environmental design.\"  The shearedokarikomishrubs suggest a treasure ship being tossed among undulating waves of the sea.Azaleacubes and spheres form the treasure in the ship piled around the almost invisible stones that are said to represent the seven gods of fortune.  To the right of the ship's prow is a separate rounded mass ofazaleawith a protruding stone forming a turtle-shapedkameshimabeneath the eaves of the building.  Behind thekameshima, running perpendicular to the viewing platform and providing a geometric counterpoint to the waves is a line ofhinoki(cypress).  In the foreground below the viewing pavilion's steps, is a round, flattened stone flanked by two more small azaleas.  This is meant to provide a place for zazen meditation while viewing the garden.The purplish-brown of winter foliage gives way to a bright floral display from late May to mid June.  This becomes lush green foliage by August and September.  In autumn, themomijimaple trees on the hillside behind burst into flame.The garden was built in the early decades after the Tokugawa government restored peace and stability at the beginning of the 17th century.  It is unclear, however, precisely when the garden was constructed.  The current pamphlet and interpretive signs both claim Kobori Enshu (1579-1647) himself designed the garden in the late 1620's.  This is certainly possible, but, like many of the gardens with which Enshu is credited, his connection here is debatable.  The temple was still in ruins during Enshu's lifetime and it seems unlikely the garden would have been built before the temple buildings were restored in.  This did not occur until twenty years after Enshu's death.  In fact, a number of references refer to his grandson being responsible for this garden.  Enshu's fame as a designer and arbiter of taste was so profound, it was not unusual for successive generations of designers to adopt his name, thereby lending legitimacy to their work.The juxtaposition of an okarikomi azalea garden sandwiched between temple buildings and a hillside is not unique to this garden.

        "JGarden Description:": "One of the prototypicalkaresansuidry gardens that works extraordinarily well in a very confined space. However, this garden is often very crowded and can take on a rather commercial tone.Daisenin Teien is one of the most celebrated gardens in Japan. It was constructed in 1509 on the grounds of the Zen temple, Daitokuji, and was completed with the main hall in 1513. The narrow garden surrounds the main hall on all four sides, encircled by akaresansuidry stream. The stream 'flows' clockwise from northeast to southwest. (Gunter Nitschke points out this is in line with Heian period geomantic principles.) Manykaresansuielements are in this garden including: a Mount Horai 'mountain', crane and turtle islands, stone bridges, and a dry waterfall. The garden is not significant for its elements, however, but rather for the spectacular way in which the Sung landscape painting tradition is turned into three-dimensional form.Karl Hennig's analysis concludes that the turtle and crane islands are the earliest part of the garden and were probably constructed by the sub-temple's founder, Kogaku Shuko (1464-1548). He was likely assisted by the, the outcaste riverbank people that were the real garden makers of the time. The landscape painter, Soami, may also have been influential, though it is unclear what role he played. It is certain that he painted several of the screens in the hall itself.The garden's layout is a clear metaphor for the human path through life. The 'river' of life begins in the northeast with the clipped camellia of Mount Horai, the land of the immortals.  It plunges through the narrow rapids of youth, broadening to emerge into adulthood. The rocks in the stream course represent the trials and tribulations that bring maturity. By the time one reaches the famous stone 'treasure boat' (originally belonged to Ashikaga Yoshimasa, but was only added in summer of 1959 when the archives revealed one used to exist at this location) in the east garden one has gained the wealth of experience. The small turtle swimming against the stream at once represents the classic symbol of good fortune and the futility of swimming against the flow of time. The south garden is the vast white gravel void at the end of life with two gravel cones the only barriers to reaching the lone Bodhi tree (under which the Buddha realizedsatori) at the far corner. For the Zen monk the garden must also represent the trials of meditating on the paradoxicalkoansof the Rinzai Zen tradition.Gunter Nitschke adds an art historical significance to the garden by pointing out that Daisenin is the first example of the exuberant themes of the Chinese Horai myth being united with the austerekaresansuigarden. As with Ryoanji, natural forms are viewed from the vantage of the main hall, but the strictly frontal, 'painted' nature of Ryoanji's composition is activated in Daisenin. One must journey 'through' the garden while never truly entering it. In this way, a static painterly approach is united with a more active landscape and architectural approach to produce something very fresh.It should be noted that there are two other small gardens but on the west and northwest but they are of little significance. Try to visit this garden early in the day. It's membership in the tourist circuit and the aspirations of its head priest, Soen Ozeki, have created a rather commercial, even circus-like atmosphere. That being said, despite the incredible volume of tourist traffic through the garden, it remains remarkably well-maintained and this is a tribute to Soen's management of the site.Bibliography:Bring, Mitchell and Wayemburgh, Josse.Japanese Gardens.

        "JGarden Description:": "The plain upon which Kyoto sits is inclined slightly toward the north and sheltered on the east, west and north sides by low, rounded mountains, giving it a very human scale.  The Kamo River, entering the city from the north is joined by the Takano at Demachiyanagi to flow straight down the east side and out toward the southwest.  Laid out on a grid plan after the T'ang capital of Ch'ang-an, Kyoto was sited not only for its central location in the Kansai region but for its supposed geomantic properties.  A site cradled by protective mountains on three sides with the highest mountain, Mt. Hiei, to the northeast (the \r\ndirection from which evil spirits were thought to come) and an opening to the south was seen as particularly auspicious. Kyoto residents have since come to see the mountains in their backyards as a mixed blessing as not only they block the cooling winds that might ease the humid summer, but also prevent the cold, damp air of winter from being swept away.Nonetheless, proximity to these mountains has long been the site of choice for the well-to-do citizen.  If one maps out the gardens and villas of Kyoto, they are almost all located on the outskirts of the original city grid, usually at the very foot of the mountains.  When one could not have a mountain actually in the backyard, a superior view of it would suffice.  These north, east and west \"suburbs\" that afforded such siting had been attractive almost from the founding of the capital in 794, but by the 16th century they were the only place of refuge for those who could afford it.  Two hundred years of internecine warfare and numerous fires had taken its toll and any location of note within the city grid had been destroyed.Tokugawa Ieyasu finally brought peace and reunification to the country in 1603, but despite its imp'verishment, the court aristocracy continued to seek refuge outside the city.  The seat of government was moved to Edo ('Tokyo' after 1868), \r\na long trip to the east from Kyoto, but the Tokugawa continued to give financial aid to the imperial court in order to legitimize its own rule.  The degree of support was much reduced, however.  From its very establishment the Tokugawa government was beset with financial difficulty and could not afford to support a lavish imperial lifestyle.  Like the temples of the time, the imperial family was forced to make do with less.Despite its limited means, over the next one hundred years, the imperial family would be responsible for some the finest gardens ever constructed then or since, including: Sento Gosho, Entsuji, Shodenji, Shugakuin, and Katsura.  In many ways this period was one of synthesis of the eclectic mixture of forms that had emerged from the previous period of chaos \r\nbefore a long decline characterized by imitation and stagnation of the garden traditions.In 1629, the Emperor Gomizuno (1596-1680) abdicated the throne while still a young man, following a long imperial tradition of relinquishment of power that had probably kept the succession of shogunates from exterminating the imperial line and setting up one of their own.  While possessing no real political power, his strong personality had often set him at odds with the military government.  The shogunate was grateful to see him step down and encouraged him to seek pastimes other than politics.  Like his predecessors, he turned his attention to the cultivation of aesthetic pursuits, the most significant of which was garden and villa construction, and in the ensuing years he established three villas at Hataeda, Iwakura and Nagatani on the northern outskirts of the city.  His primary residence was the imperial palace at Sento Gosho, but as the villas were completed from 1644 to 1650, he began taking retreats, alternating between them with the change of the seasons.The modest \"detached palace\" at Hataeda, located about a kilometer  due north of the city near what is",

        "JGarden Description:": "Kyoto was founded in 794 by Emperor Kammu.  When Kyoto celebrated the eleven hundredth anniversary of its establishment it was already the third decade of the Meiji era.  In part to commemorate the event and in part to console its citizens for the removal of the imperial family to Tokyo, the local government decided to build a large Shinto shrine devoted to this early emperor.  The shrine structure itself was to be based upon the design of the Heian period Hall of State, theChodo-in, built by Kammu as part of the imperial palace grounds and was to be built in the spirit of Heian architecture.  This proved difficult, however.  Despite the building being scaled down by one-third, incomplete knowledge of the original plans made construction of an exact replica impossible.  But the great difficulty lay with a fundamental transformation of function from secular (a hall of state) to sacred (a Shinto shrine), in terms of the building, and from the sacred garden of the Heian period in which all elements were encoded with significance in a Buddhist cosmology to that of an Edo/Meiji secular garden within which a public could walk after worshipping at the shrine.1Ogawa Jihei developed a rather romantic, naturalistic design with a large palette of plants -- some imported from Europe -- designed to provide visual interest in all seasons.  The garden is quite extensive, covering about five acres. A visitor begins on the west end of the garden passing first through an area dominated by willows and flowering cherries. The planting shifts as one moves around the sequence of water features that enfold the shrine proper. In the eastsawatari-ishi, or stepping stones, meander across the water to a tiny island.  These stones inscribe a visual footnote in local history as they were also the foundation stones for the piers of the Gojo Bridge prior it its reconstruction during Meiji.  The final element and most prominent garden feature is the Taihei-kaku, a covered bridge spanning the south section of the pond.  The style shows some Chinese influence and is reminiscent of Kinkakuji and Ginkakuji, the Gold and Silver Pavilions.  The extension of this walking surface over the water also refers to Heian period pond gardens.While the garden at Heian Shrine is hardly successful as a re-creation of the Heian period garden, it marks the beginning of a garden-building boom in the Nanzenji area.  To the list of villas described above, one might add the Nomura Residence, Seifuso and Tofukuji.Notes:1.  Nietschke, p. 213.  This analysis presupposes a sacred/secular dualism that may not yet have been part of the Meiji mental landscape.  Indeed the emperor was both divine and secular until the close of World War II.  It would be interesting to investigate to what extent this transformation of secular to sacred and vice versa was actually troubling to the Meiji people of Kyoto.  What was the confluence of forces through which the necessarily interdependent ideas of 'public' and 'private' arose?BibliographyItoh Teiji.Space and Illusion.Tokyo: Weatherhill, 1973, p. 40.Kuck, Loraine.World of the Japanese Garden: From Chinese origins to modern landscape art.

        "JGarden Description:": "Isuien is located in Nara, several miles to the southeast of Kyoto and the site of the capital for several decades prior to 794.  The garden lies just southwest of the great Todaiji temple and is actually two separate gardens.  The small lower or western garden is built around a pond with two islands representing the crane and turtle, the classic symbols of longevity.  It was built in the early Edo period around the 1670's by Kiyosumi Michikiyo, a wealthy textile merchant who managed to escape the sumptuary laws.Momentos of Kiyosumi's trade make an appearance in the larger, eastern garden built by Tojiro Seki, another Nara merchant in the early 1890's.  This so-called rear or upper garden was probably designed by Horitoku, a garden architect patronized by the Ura Senke school of Tea.  Another retainer of the Ura Senke school, the carpenter, Kimura Seibei, was commissioned to build Hyoshintei, the pavilion on the west side of the pond.The pond in the eastern garden inscribes the Chinese character for \"water\" and contains a small island, reached by the millstones mentioned above.  The basic layout is a stroll garden with some artificial hills, three-tiered waterfall and minimal rockwork, much being replaced by topiaried azaleas as was common throughout the Meiji period.This garden is another excellent example of scenery external to the garden being capture alive.  Theshakkeihere, intended for a viewer near the Hyoshintei pavilion captures the three hills of Nara, Wakakusa, Kasuga and Mikusa, which are foregrounded by the upper part of the South Gate of Todaiji.  The capture is effected by the nearby woods of Himuro Shrine, framing the view and trimming out the intervening ground plane.The two larger gardens on east and west are separated by a much more modestly scaled tea garden with two pavilions at either end connected by a path of stepping stones.BibliographyItoh Teiji.Space and Illusion.Tokyo: Weatherhill, 1973, p. 43.Mori Osamu.Teien Shohakka.Tokyo: Tokyo-do, 1993, p. 319-320.Nietschke, Gunter.Japanese Gardens: Right angle and natural form.Cologne: Taschen, 1993, p. 220-221.",

        "JGarden Description:": "The Golden Pavilion (Kinkaku) is a three-story viewing and pleasure pavilion constructed on the edge of a pond as the focal point to a much larger garden on the grounds of the Rokuonji Temple.  It gains its more popular name of 'Kinkakuji' from the gold plating on the exterior of the pavilion.The site in northern Kyoto was the developed as a large retirement estate by Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1358-1409) beginning in 1394. The pavilion itself was sited at the edge of a sprawling palace complex that no longer exists.  This was intended as proof that the warrior shogunate could contribute to the cultural and aesthetic life of the land to an extent equal to that of the imperial aristocracy.  This was born out by the visit from the emporer in 1408, the first time an emperor had ever stayed with a person that was not a member of the imperial court.  The shogun died the following year.  The palace complex was turned over to the Rinzai sect of Zen Buddhism upon Yoshimitsu's death and it has remained in their care since then.The pavilion is based on the Chinese Sung style, though each floor has a somewhat different aesthetic.  The first floor was used as a reception room for guests and as boarding site for pleasure boating around the small pond.  The second story was for more private parties with an outstanding view of the garden. The third floor was an intimate space for meeting with confidantes and holding tea ceremony. Originally, only the ceiling of the pavilion's third floor was gilt, but in 1950, a student monk burned the pavilion to the ground.  When an exact replica was reconstructed in its place, it was decided to cover the exterior in its namesake gold.The grounds surrounding the pavilion lie on four and a half acres, but the use of landscape elements make its apparent size much larger.  The foreground is filled with small scale rocks and plantings.  The more distant elements blend into the background, visually extending the garden.  Mt Kinugasa rises in the background. Meanwhile, the chaotic shoreline undulates to and fro, disguising the pond's true size.The delicate nature of the pavilion make entry by the large number of annual visitors impossible.  Most people follow a path that encircles the pond and then continues up the side of a hill to a very rustic tea pavilion.Further ReadingMishima Yukio. translated by Ivan Morris.The Temple of the Golden Pavilion.

        "JGarden Description:": "Murinan is the former home and final residence of Yamagata Aritomo, a Meiji statesman and garden enthusiast.  Yamagata worked with Ogawa Jihei on this garden and the attached two-storysukiyastyle house from 1892 to 1896.  As a product of the Meiji period, this home represents a juxtaposition between a classic taste and the Western-influenced modernism that was influential in Japan at the time.  The one hectare site is primarily covered with mowed lawn, but twoyarimizustreams, clusters of stones and clipped shrubs line the water features that meander across the space.  It is one of the finest residential gardens open to the public in Kyoto.The garden is located in SE Kyoto, nearNanzenjiand theMiyako Hotel.Yamagata Aritomo1, a member of the aristocracy and a veteran statesman the late 19th century, bought land in the Kusakawa-cho neighborhood and proceeded to build a villa and garden there in 1892, completing it in 1896.  He hired Ogawa Jihei as his designer.  Ogawa will reappear as the designer of a number of gardens in the Meiji period includingHeian ShrineandShinshin-an,and he had a hand in virtually all of those constructed in Kusakawa-cho.In this case Ogawa created a stroll garden around two pairs of brooks and shallow ponds, all fed by water from the new canal.  He \"captured alive\" (ikidoriorshakkei) the entire Higashiyama mountain range through the device of two groves of trees growing in the area around the property.  The trees form both the vertical elements and the horizontal trimming line to frame the mountains.  Below the gap in the trees, the eye is drawn down a three-tiered cascade from which the water flows over a miniature rapids into the first pond.  A second stream flows from the north part of the garden and is spanned by a bridge from which a rock composition at the confluence of the streams can be seen.  Other such compositions are interspersed among the clipped shrubs in a way that draws the eye across the intervening lawn space.A member of the so-called \"literary\" tradition and considered a progressive thinker in his time, Yamagata's preferences were toward what was known as the \"naturalistic\" rather than the more stylized gardens and limited palette of earlier periods.  Despite this, the garden is firmly rooted in the Edo stroll garden tradition with Ogawa offering little innovation other than the introduction of some European plant materials and the deployment of patches of lawn around the buildings.  The topiaried azalea, the use ofshakkeito draw outside elements into the garden, and the revealing and hiding of views as one passes around a prescribed path are the techniques that structure the experience of the garden and would be recognizable to anyone familiar with gardens throughout the last two centuries.Notes:1. Yamagata Aritomo (1838-1922) was born a samurai of the Yamaguchi clan.  The members of this family were leaders in the 1866 revolt that ultimately brought down the Tokugawa shogun two years later.  As a result, they were made noble after the Restoration.  Aritomo served as Minister of Justice, President of the Privy Council, general in the Sino-Japanese War and Prime Minister.  In addition to Murinan, he commissioned the gardens, Chinzan-so in Tokyo and Koki-an in Odawara.BibliographyItoh Teiji.Space and Illusion.Tokyo: Weatherhill, 1973, p. 41.Kuck, Loraine.World of the Japanese Garden: From Chinese origins to<",

After the Meiji restoration in 1868, Nijo became an imperial villa but it was given to the City of Kyoto in 1939.Iemitsu (3rd Tokugawa shogun) was responsible for hiring Kobori Enshu to renovate the garden and expand the buildings in 1624 in preparation for a visit by Emperor Gomizuno(1596-1680). This renovation was not the last, however, and Ninomaru Teien has undergone several alterations since then. At times the large, central lake has been a 'dry garden' though it is not known if this was the original design.  The garden is about one acre in size and lies southwest of the castle, itself.It is possible to stroll in the garden, but the best views were designed to be seen from the buildings.There is an older section, called Honmaru-jo, on the western half of the site; only the foundation of the remains after it burned in the 1800's",

        "JGarden Description:": "Ryoanji, the most prominent example ofkaresansuior dry landscape gardens, is on a site that has had a temple on it since 983. The original temple was destroyed during the Onin Wars.  The current garden was probably designed during the rebuilding of the temple in 1488.  It is believed to be the only surviving example of a new type of Japanese garden that appeared at this time, primarily under the influence of Zen monks.  Its origins are often debated and some peole content that the original garden included trees and plants and that it was only altered to its present state more recently.  It's influences range from the small tray gardens of China and Japan, the pebble grounds on the sites of Shinto shrines, and the black ink landscape painting favored by Zen monks. It is not possible to attribute the garden to a single designer, though many credit Soami (1480?-1525). Temple records include the names of several others and one of the stones includes the names of Kotaro and Hikojaro, probably two laborers that did the actual construction.More recently, the main building burned in 1789 and a larger structure was moved here from another site. The east side of the garden was shortened to make room for a new gate and in 1977-78, the roof of the building was and garden wall were repaired, changing the character of the garden somewhat (clay tile was replaced with cedar shingles and the texture of the facing wall changed.The 15 stones are arranged in 5 groups on a bed of raked white sand.  Loraine Kuck calls it a 'sermon in stone', but there are dozens of theories about its meaning from folk explanations about a tiger crossing a river with her cubs to mountaintops above clouds to islands in the sea.  All of the stones appear to be flowing in water from left to right except one.The extreme level of abstraction present in this site was a new height for Japanese gardens and may have been influenced by Zen.  It continues to influence contemporaries in many professions to this day.Bibliography:Bring, Mitchell and Wayemburgh, Josse.Japanese Gardens.

        "JGarden Description:": "One's first impression of this garden is its size.  It is about 4.5 acres in extent (about the same as theGolden Pavilion) and the darkness of the forest, water and shadows make it seem larger yet.  It is fundamentally a stroll garden and though it is now known for the moss that covers every surface (giving it the alternative Kokedera appellation) it was not originally constructed as a moss garden.There has been a temple on this southwest Kyoto site since the eighth century.  It was reconstructed in 1339 by the Zen priest and noted garden designer, Muso Kokushi who had taken over the temple in 1334 and turned it into a Zen monaster.  For him, meditation in the garden was the best means by which one might experience Buddha mind.While several structures populated the temple complex after Kokushi reconstruciton campaign, the fifteenth century Onin Wars destroyed all of them.  Today all that remains is the recently built Founder's Hall and two tea houses, one of which is Shonantei.Several reconstructions obscure the form built by Kokushi and while we know this is the earliest extent example of akare-sansuigarden, it is unclear if it represents a prototype of a new Zen garden or the continuation of an existing Heian garden type.  Nonetheless, we do know that substantial work had already been done on the garden prior to Kokushi's arrival.  The pond around which it is designed is typical of the Jodo Buddhism Paradise garden common in the Heian period. In these site, the garden is considered a material representation of the paradise one will enjoy if brought into the land of the Amida Buddha.  The shape of the large pond has seen several transformations.  It now has several islands.  The islands are connected by bridges anchored to rock formations.  Among the hillier portiions of the garden are its three most noted rock compositions.  They include akame-shimaor Turtle Island formation floating in a bed of moss, thezazen-sekior meditation stone, and an extraordinarykare-taki. The latter composition is a series of stepped rocks that evoke a cascade of water, though none appears.If you are planning on visiting the garden, you will have to plan ahead as it is no longer open to the public due to the damage being done by the heavy foot traffic of tourists.  You will need to write the temple ahead of time to obtain permission to visit.Marc Treib reports that the best time to see the moss is from May to June, but that the Japanese Maples here are quite spectacular in the autumn as well.Location:Kyoto, Ukyo-ku, Matsuo, Kamigatani-choTime Period:1339Designer(s):Muso KokushiBibliography:Bring, Mitchell and Wayemburgh, Josse.Japanese Gardens.

        "JGarden Description:": "Shinju-an (the 'Pearl Temple') is a sub-temple of Daitokuji.  Founded in honor of Ikkyu, son of Emperor Gokomatsu. Ikkyu lived here for several years, and, after giving up the right to the throne, became the abbot of Daitokuji from 1474 to 1481.  He is remembered for the being  responsible for rebuilding Daitokuji after its destruction in the Onin Wars.  He is also remembered for his patronage of artists such as Juko Murata, the founder of the tea ceremony and Kanami, Seami and Konparu, creators of the Noh theatre.  The remains of Juko, Kanami and Seami were all interred at Shinju-an.The site consists of three buildings, thekuri(living quarters), thehon-do(main hall) and theshoin(study) with an attached tea house.  Thekuriand thehon-doare connected by a veranda.  A second passage connects theshoinand thehon-do.  All three buildings are listed by the national government as 'Important Cultural Assets'.Thehon-dowas thought to have been built in 1490, but recent research has shown that it is a reconstruction dating from 1638.  It consists of three rooms and a garden.  The West Room contains the oldest screen paintings in Japan, a series of eight landscape panels painted by Jasoku Soga, a contemporary of Ikkyu that was converted to Zen Buddhism by the priest.  The Central Room has a wooden sculpture of Ikkyu as well as several more Jasoku Soga screen paintings of birds and flowers.  The East Room contains Momoyama period paintings by Hasegawa Tohaku (1539-1610) portraying the legend of Han Dynasty Emperor Koso and the rivalry between his two sons.Theshoinbuilding, known as 'Tsusen-in', was originally part of the imperial palace of Emperor Ogimachi, before it was transferred here from the Gosho.  It is worth noting that the Empress was the mother of Prince Toshihito(1579-1629), who designed and contructed theKatsura Detached Palace, another important example of Shoin architecture.  The screen paintings in this building are by Soami, also from the Muromachi period.  Another set of landscape paintings, opposite the entrance to the tea house, were inspired by Lake Seiko in China and painted by Kano Motonobu (1475-1559).  A final set of paintings in the south central room are by Tosa Mitsuoki.The tea house, attached the the east side of theshoin, was built by Kanamori Sowa in the late 17th century.  Kanamori was a daimyo and tea master from the Japan Alps.  His snowy origins are said to have caused him to relocated the stone wash basin from its normal position facing the garden, to the interior.  The stone basin had also been a gift of Emperor Ginsoku, moved here at the same time as theshoinbuilding.The East Garden's design is attributed to Muraka Juko (Shuko), Ashikaga Yoshimasa's tea master.  It includes a combination of rocks in groupings of seven, five and three against a background of moss.  The garden is throught to have originally been set against the background of the Higashiyama hills, the Kamo River and the Kyoto, with Mt Hiei in the distant background.  Today, large trees and buildings form a very different backdrop.Other local relics include a wash basin near the passage between thehondoand theshoinand a well where Murasaki Shikibu (author of theTale of Genji) is said to have washed as a child. (Her remains are interred nearby.)",

Though it covers barely an acre, the garden seems much larger.  Ogawa probably designed it, but the construction was overseen by his colleagues Tomokichi and Genbei.  The site is topographically much more varied than at Murinan but similar techniques are employed.  Water from the canal is brought in as a stream to supply the pond around which a path is arranged such that, as one walks, a sequence of views is revealed and hidden.  Again woods are used to capture the view, in this case the triple gate at Nanzenji and the background of the Nanzenji Hills, Ayato Forest and the Nanzenji Bell Tower.  The pine trees that form the frame and trimming line have since grown somewhat high for proper effect, but for several decades after construction, the Gate appeared to float in the air above its own shadow.   More rocks were originally placed along the edge of the water but have since been removed, allowing the slope to be more clearly articulated.  Matsushita Konosuke the present owner, renamed the garden Shinshinan and also added two smallkaresansuigardens with cryptomeria (sugi) trees rising up out of the raked white sand.BibliographyItoh Teiji.Space and Illusion.Tokyo: Weatherhill, 1973, p. 40-43.Heineken, Ty. \"Gardens: Shinshin-An in Kyoto\".Architectural Digest. v. 41, no. 1, Jan. 1984, p. 114-119.",

        "JGarden Description:": "The origin of this temple lie in the volatile Momoyama (16th century) period.  Nene, the wife of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, built Kodaiji and the North Garden (Kita-teien) at Fushimi castle for her husband.  When he died, the garden was transferred to Kyoto from Fushimi.  Construction of the temple, Kodai-in, began in 1603 with some garden work being done two years later.  The name was changed to Kodaiji in 1606.  Entokuin, built in 1627, is actually a subtemple of the Kodaiji complex, located across the street.  The narrow street that passes between Entokuin and Kodaiji is still called Nene Street.There are actually two gardens here, North and South.  The North Garden is quite interesting.  The original design was not Enshu, but he may have had a hand in some of the modifications.  Originally designed as a pond garden, it is now akaresansuidry garden.  LikeEntsuji, the stones are arranged in a semi-circle among grass and moss.  It is particularly notable for its dry waterfallishigumi.  The South garden was only constructed very recently and has not yet matured, but is still worth seeing.  It consists of a large expanse of raked gravel bounded by an undulating border of stone, trees, moss and undergrowth.In the late fall, Entokuin puts on a nighttime light show.  We're not sure when the light show began, but it's supposed to be quite spectacular.The garden is now maintained byKitayama Zoen,the garden design firm ofKitayama Yasuo.The head priest here is Goto Tensho.  It has got to be one of the first Japanese temples to go online, complete with a page flogging the priest's own book.",

The three gardens are intended to represent three periods of time: Heian, Muromachi/Momoyama and Modern. The Heian garden is constructed in the Shinden style with two streams leading to a pond, an island in the middle of the pond and a waterfall flowing down a hill. The Muromachi/Momoyama garden has a pond with a tea house and a rock garden. The modern garden has clipped hedges around a pool with a fountain. Marc Treib and Ron Herman suggest that cherry trees, azaleas and wisteria make a spring visit worthwhile and that the temple suggests visiting in the late afternoon as the best time.",

        "JGarden Description:": "This is one of the oldest gardens known in Japan.  It was excavated in the 1980's when it was discovered on the site of proposed post office buildings.  Excavation revealed a pond in the shape of an 'S' lined with a layer of fist-sized stones.  This pond was known as a 'kyuseki' or 'gyuseki' and was approximately 50ft (15m) across and 175ft (55m) in length. Some distance away, a small reservoir feeds the pond through a system of wooden conduits and locks.  This reservoir is, in turn, fed by the Kamogawa. Several wooden,  box-like containers were found in the pond. These were probably aquatic planters of some type (Kuitert). On the west site of the pond was a Chinese-style pavilion.  A fence surrounded both the pond and the building with some buildings outside it for preparation of food and drinks.Near the piles of the building were found roof tiles that are identical to those used on the Nara Imperial Palace.  It is therefore likely that this was a type of informal detached palace or retreat, though it is not mentioned in any of the known written materials.This site was most likely used for holding banquets in which guests sat on along the banks.  Each guest was required to compose a poem before a floating cup of wine reached them from across the pond.  This type of event is thought to have been inspired by the Chinese calligrapher Wang Xi Zhi (303-379) when he held a banquet such as this. A very famous anthology of poetry resulted from the Chinese event (held in 353) and this is likely to have inspired later imitations in Korea and Japan.After the excavation was completed, this site was restored to its former state, including a pond with a couple of feet of water. The post office was located elsewhere.ReferencesKuitert, Wybe. \"Two Early Gardens\".The Aesthetic Garden: A Symposium on Gardens. edited by L. Tjon Sie Fat and Eric de Jong.

        "JGarden Description:": "The garden on this site provides a gateway to the NBI Cultural and Resouce Center.  The design was a collaborative one that has included the EvCC, the NBI staff,Zen Landscape and DesignandJapanese Architects and Builders.Everett's sister city in western Japan, Iwakuni City, has donated a portion of their famous, arched Kintai Bridge to the garden project. Wood structures salvaged from the Kintai Bridge's bi-century reconstruction project will be formed into a smaller bridge structure and placed in the NBI Japanese garden as an expression of harmony between Japan and the USA. The bridge was delivered and assembled at the garden site by a group of carpenters traveling from Iwakuni City to Everett in summer 2003.  (The head carpenter is the 11th generation of the family who were specialized in construction of the Kintai Bridge that was originally built in 1673.)Over $350,000 has been raised and pledged through private donations, grants, and other gifts for the design, construction, and maintenance of the garden. The project is managed through the NBI and evcc Foundation, with valuable assistance from the NBI garden advisory committee. Zen Landscape & Design and Sukiya Home Inc. will construct the major garden features, including a water feature and garden gate and wall. The project was opened in June 2004.From the NBI:Since 1987 the Nippon Business Institute Japanese Cultural and Resource Center has been a program department of Everett Community College in Everett, Washington.  The primary mission of the NBI is to help \"Bridge the Cultural Gap\" which exists between eastern and western cultures.  With our mission in mind, we promote the study of language, history, culture, social structure, economic issues, communication styles, and business protocols.  We also facilitate a wide array of interactions between local businesses and Japanese companies, as well as between members of our community and their Japanese friends and associates.The NBI Japanese Cultural and Resource Center is a new facility, providing a home, from which we are able to conduct our programs.  Initial funding for the center was provided by the Commemorative Association for the Japan World Exposition (1970)along with many generous private individuals, groups, organizations and companies.  Designed by architect Kazuyuki Murata, the Center's construction has occurred in two phases.  Phase I construction was completed in May 1997; Phase II was completed in October 1999.The NBI Japanese Cultural Center's amenities include: administrative offices, student computer labs which house computers capable of both Japanese and English language functions, meeting space, a demonstration kitchen, a small library of Japanese books that can be checked out, a Japanese tatami room for tea ceremony instruction, and classrooms.The garden has been the third and final phase of the project.",

The Rengeji-style lantern is an upright lantern with a steeply-pitched, cone-shaped roof.JOJGnotes that this garden has not been well maintained in recent years and that the caretaker is can be a bit aggressive.Rengeji is located along the Eizan Line tramway north of the Kyoto near the Miyake Hachiman Station.

The garden here is attached to the Hondo of the temple and was constructed when the building was rebuilt in 1676.  Features in the garden include a grass-coveredsanzon(three mountain) formation stretching from east to west and split by akaretakidry waterfall.  The narrow pond, below, has turtle and stone islands.  Thisshukkei karesansuigarden depicts the literary and religious events described in Ennin'sRecord of a Pilgramage to China.  In the story, the priest Egaku is shipwrecked. After he regains the sea, he stops at the island of Fuda-san on the way back to T'ang China and leaves a statue of the Kannon there. The garden tells the story.  Fuda-san is in the center with the priest's boat anchored to the rocks. White sand represents the sea.  The garden was designed by Koten, a Zen priest and founder of the temple.5,810 sq ft.This garden is sited on the north side of the main temple hall, facing south. It is bounded on the north and east by a steep slope. A long, narrow pond runs east-west across the garden. Its shores are dotted with small mounds of clipped hedges and medium-sized stones. On the east side of a central Horai mound is a dry waterfall arrangement of stones.  The flow of the stone waterfall is toward the pond, evoking a rapids feeding the pool. In contrast to the rough edge of the narrow pond, the pond on the southern edge has almost no stones or shrubs to articulate its shore. Rather it is almost a straight line. Mori Osamu speculates this arrangement is probably based garden making texts of the late Edo period.BibliographyMori Osamu.Teien. 1993. p 332.",

He agreed to Giyen's request to restore the gardens and temple and construction began immediately. The work was completed in six weeks, though Yoshiro (Kentei) worked on the garden for another twenty years afterward. The garden is supposed to include 700 stones, most of which came from other locations. Hideyoshi's own palace, Jurakudai, was the source for many of them.The temple also boasts other gardens including a double-gourd arrangement near the Hondo and several smaller ones.",

The main garden was constructed in the Muromachi period and is attributed to Soami.  An eastern garden is also attributed toKobori Enshu.Shigemori Mirei, the garden designer and historian, maintains, however, that the garden was probably reconstructed in the Edo.  Following the Meiji era fire, the garden was reconstructed once more byOgawa Jiheiin 1909.This garden is known for its excellent acoustics and is sometimes the site ofkotoconcerts.  It is a small pond garden with groupings of rocks and shrubs surrounding the pond.Marc Treibstates that it was originally intended to be viewed from the buildings, though paths now snake through the garden.  A \"Kirishima garden\" has some Kirishima azaleas that date from the 19th century and arojileads to theKobun-teiteahouse.",

It was designed to include all of the landscapes types of Japan.TheJOJG2003 Australian Garden Surveylisted this as one of six highest-quality Japanese gardens in Australia.The GardenCompleted in 1979, this garden has become Cowra's main tourist attraction. The five hectare stroll (kaiyu-shiki) garden features tea pavilion, Bonsai House, drykaresansuigarden, Pottery House, an arbor, wisteria pergola, two koi ponds, waterfalls, streams with bridges, a bonsho (bell), stone lantern, viewing platforms, views of Cowra and Lachlan Valley, gift shop, and a nursery selling plants and bonsai.Over 120 species of birds have made their home in the garden permanently or seasonally and there are over 113 types of trees, flowers and shrubs to be seen in this ever changing Garden. Plant species include: flowering cherry, cedar, rose, persimmon, downy maple and flowering quince, liquid ambers, golden ash, maples, Chinese tallozvs, silver birch, wattles, jacarandas, magnolias, camellias, lilacs, honeysuckle, rosemary, bamboo, dwarf diosma, crepe myrtle, daffodils, irises, may bushes and jasmine.Cultural CentreIn addition to the garden, a Cultural Centre has three galleries of exhibits including:\r\nNanga paintings, Kabuki, Hakata, Noh and Daruma dolls, ceremonial kimonos and masks, model samurai and weapons, a collection of Japanese ceramics, Arita porcelain and Shippo Yaki, a Somenishiki ornamental vase, model torii gates, a 300 year-old Hanabusa scroll.In early October, the spring blossoms transform the Garden and it becomes the focus of Sakura Matsuri, Cowra's annual Cherry Blossom festival. Besides enjoying the myriad of blossoms, visitors can join the Garden's Japanese guests and see demonstrations of Japanese arts and crafts including Ikebana, Bonsai, Calligraphy, Pottery and Origami, observe the tea ceremony and listen to a recital of the Shakuhachi flute. The martial arts of Kendo and Karate are demonstrated, there is kite flying and Japanese food can be sampled.Cowra's Japanese ConnectionCowra's involvement with the Japanese began during World War II when the Australian Government built a prisoner-of-war camp on the outskirts of the town. It originally housed Germans and Italians, but when war spread into the Pacific region, Japanese, Formosan, Javanese and Korean prisoners were also accommodated at the camp.Before dawn on August 5,1944, over 1000 of the Japanese prisoners staged a breakout that was to go into the history books as the biggest military mass escape of all time. Tragically, it left 231 Japanese and four Australians dead. The Japanese who died in that breakout were buried in Cowra; members of the local R.S.L. Subbranch took it upon themselves to look after their graves. From that first humanitarian gesture grew the desire to understand more about the culture and lifestyles of a people who had been an enemy.In 1962, Japanese Embassy officials, impressed with the attention paid to the graves of their war dead, approached the Cowra Council to discuss the possibility of one cemetery for all Japanese who had died on Australian soil during the war years and for that cemetery to be located in Cowra. And so, in 1964, a Japanese War Cemetery, designed by Shigeru Yura, was built. It now contains the remains of all Japanese nationals who died in the Cowra breakout, the attack on Darwin and the Australian internment and POW camps.The World Peace BellAustralia's replica of the World Peace Bell was placed in Cowra because of the efforts of the local people to foster peace and international understanding, not only with the Japanese but all nations. It stands in Civic Square off Kendal Street.  It is an exact replica of the Peace Bell in the Japanese ga",

His design was implemented by Mitani Kozo, also of Japan.  The University of Alberta, Edmonton operates the garden, which is carefully designed to harmonize with the topography and native vegetation.  It is part of the larger Devonian Botanical Gardens.A traditional-style gate graces the entry and the garden features an arched bridge, a thirteen-story carved granite pagoda, a bell tower, anazumaya(open-sided shelter), a pavilion, a wooden bridge, a large pond and several stone lanterns.  The stream meandering down a slope to the pond is artfully lined with stones and gives a convincing impression.  This stonework was executed by Mr. Kubo and Mr. Mitani.  Plantings includeLarix sibiricaand lovely effects of moss and lichens.Located at the edge of the garden, the Ozawa Pavilion is a sukiya-style structure which commands a spectacular view of the garden.  It serves to promote cultural exchange between Canada and Japan and provides a setting for workshops and retreats.Dr. Yuichi Kurimoto, who was the first Japanese national to graduate from the University of Alberta\u2019s Faculty of the Arts in 1930, gives the garden its name.  The 1,500-pound friendship bell gracing the bell tower symbolizes the friendship between Nagoya Shoka University (which was founded by Dr. Kurimoto) and the University of Alberta.Events include demonstrations of the tea ceremony several times each year, a spring festival and walks led by a horticulturist.

In the early 1960s the idea for the Nikka Yuko Japanese garden was conceived by Reverend Yutetsu Kawamura, a Buddhist minister familiar with Japanese gardens, and Cleo Mowers, the editor and publisher of theLethbridge Herald.  Others in the community provided enthusiastic support, and building the garden became part of the 1967 Canadian Centennial project.  The garden would honor the cultural contributions of Japanese-Canadians and provide an avenue for cultural exchange and understanding.  A million people from around the world have visited the garden to date.The four-acre site is laid out as a stroll garden and includes a dry rock garden (karesansui), a waterfall, streams and bridges, ponds and islands and a flat prairie garden.  The garden incorporates plants native to North America and takes advantage of borrowed views (shakkei) of nearby Henderson Lake.The garden centers around a large sukiya-style pavilion stretching out over the pond\u2019s edge and built in the traditional manner by Japanese carpenters using Taiwanese cypress.  The pavilion, bridges, gates and other buildings were all crafted in Japan by artisans then reassembled at the site, imparting a strong flavor of  authenticity and quality to the garden.The garden was designed by the late Dr. Kubo Tadashi and his assistant Sugimoto Masami.  Dr. Kubo designed more than two dozen gardens in Japan, Canada, Singapore and the United States and served as Professor of Urban Landscape Design at Osaka University.  He received his PhD in Forestry from Hokkaido University in 1960, authored many books and articles on urban landscape design and environmental planning and design, and received many awards.See also:Journal of Japanese Gardening, no 12, Nov/Dec 1999, pp 36-37.Located within Henderson (Lake) Park just East off the Start of Highway 4",

        "JGarden Description:": "The Butchart Gardens are the legacy of Robert Pim Butchart and his wife, Jenny.  Robert Butchart began in dry goods, but in 1888, he establisehd a Portland Cement manufacturing facility near Owen Sound, Ontario, his birthplace.  He became a very successful industrial leader and later moved to the west coast of Canada, following the limestone deposits located on Vancouver Island.  In 1904, he and his family moved their home to the Tod Inlet site and settled there for the remainder of the lives.  When Butchart had mined out the limestone at the factory near their house, Jenny Butchart suggested using the big hole in the ground to build a Sunken Garden.  Top soil was brought in and the work began.In 1908, the garden was expanded to include a Japanese Garden on the ocean-side of the estate.  An Italian garden and Rose garden were added later as well.  Little now remained of the old limestone kiln, though the factory continued to make tiles and flower pots until as late as 1950. (The old kiln chimney can still be seen from the Sunken Garden.)By the 1920's, the garden was becoming a destination and more than 50,000 visitors arrived annually.  The Butchart's changed the estate's name to 'Benvenuto', Italian for welcome and kept on growing the place.The Butchart Gardens remains a property of the Butchart family.  R. Ian Ross owned and operated the site until 1997.  It is now owned by members of the Butchart/Ross family.  More than a million people visit the site annually.No one from JGarden has visited this site, but we've received reports that the Japanese garden, at least, is nothing to write home about.  rc.",

        "JGarden Description:": "Presented to the Town of Hope on July 27, 1991, this garden was built by local Japanese Canadians for two purposes.  It was designed to commemorate the Japanese interned during World War II in the Tashme Camp, located about 20 km east of Hope on Highway 3.  It was also intended to demonstrate Japanese culture to the general public.  The design and construction were supervised by theJapanese Gardeners Cooperative of British Columbia.The garden is quite small and consists of a clipped yew hedge bouding a roughly square garden space that is located on Wallace Street in the corner of the much larger Memorial Park and next to the Town Hall (325 Wallace St).  Two stone sentinals guard the single gateway.  Three large cherries shade the west edge of the space with a large stone and waterfall on the North side.  The hedge on the north side frames a view of the mountains that surround Hope.  The center of the garden is dominated by a pond.  The garden is also planted with hostas, ferns, black pine and japanese maples.  A small stone lantern has been erected at the north end of the pond.  The inscription reads, \"Erected through proceeds from the 1976 Tashme Reunion held at the Japanese Canadian Cultural Centre.  Don Mills, Toronto Ontario\"I visited in September 2000.  The garden seemed a bit unkempt at the time with the pond being a bit green and vandalism clearly being a problem.  However, the site is surrounded with some spectacular fir trees in the surrounding park and this lends a sense of majesty to the space. (RC)",

        "JGarden Description:": "The garden covers three acres behind Bennett Fountain on Queensway (just off Water Street) near the downtown, not far from the Railway Station.  It includes a pond, waterfall, and stone garden covering three acres.  It was built as part of a sister-city relationship with Kasugai, Japan.This is an amazing garden.  It lies inside a walled enclosure next to the City Hall of Kelowna, British Columbia.  If you drove by on the nearby commercial street, you'd never realize it was even there.  You need to walk by the large Bennett Fountain with its skateboarding denizens, down the tree-lined path between the walls and the City Hall to the large wooden gates, marked by a dedication plaque.  The garden itself is lively with a diversity of people and animals.  On the day I was there, I saw people visiting City Hall, middle school students on their way home filling up plastic water bottles along the way,a homeless person drinking out the bamboo fountain, a couple with their children strolling the paths, rollerblading thrashers drinking beer behind the reeds along the stream, ducks, koi and chipmunks.  In other words, this isn't a precious garden that's been either exoticized or put on an artistic pedestal.  Rather, it is part of the everyday life of the citizens of Kelowna.The garden is a well-designed example of a Japanese-inspired garden.  It beautifully integrates stone, water, plants, walls, paths and people.  It's design encompasses many possible interpretations and, thankfully, there are no signs explaining how we should interpret the space.   A path meanders along the outside edge of the entire space.  As you enter , the path begins with a dry garden on the right.  This then continues around counterclockwise around one side of a reed-enshrouded stream, across a small bridge to the other side of the stream and then along the wall opposite from the entrance.  A larger bridge presents itself part way along the walk, giving you a choice of continuing in this circular path or of cutting back to the opposite side.  The far end of the garden includes a waterfall that cascades over rocks into a large pond.  The path circles around the pond and back toward the entrance, passing by a pavilion, a bamboo fountain and other features along the way.Visited 1 September 2000, 3pm.",

        "JGarden Description:": "Polson Park is a large recreation and leisure park on the south end of Vernon.  You'll have to drive through some winding roads to find the Japanese garden which is carved out of the southeast corner of the park.  The space is shaped rather like a penninsula of land surrounded by an asphalt road on three sides.  Ducks, geese and pigeons jam the road with more congestion than an urban highway during rush hour.  Five enormous willow trees separate the garden from a large lawn and the rest of the park.  The center of the garden is dominated by a moderately sized pond with a pebble beach at one end.What impressed me most about this garden was the attempt to integrate native species with Japanese varieties.  But on the whole, it's not been well maintained and the quality of the construction leaves much to be desired.  The pond in the center of the garden has poor circulation.  The base of the pond is relatively cheap cement.  It looks like there were a couple of bridges originally, but only a cement one remains.  The second one has only its abuttments to speak for its former presence.  The conifers have been trimmed but in an amateurish fashion, leaving them looking gangly and awkward rather than graceful.   The builders of this garden undoubtedly had grand ambitions, but the garden's location at the far end little traveled corner of a very large park, attests to the lack of political and financial clout necessary to maintain such a structure.Despite being a small town, Vernon does boast some attractions other than Polson Park and the Japanese Garden.  A few highlights include a 'Taoist Tai Chi Garden', the Vernon Art Gallery, the town's Museum and Library and the Interior Space and Science Center.Visited 9/1/2000, 5pm",

Though Slocan and Tashme were larger camps , this site is located in the adjacent village, New Denver, where internees were also kept.  The New Denver 'Orchard' camp has the dubious distinction of having been operated by the BC Security Commission until 1957.  Over 20,000 Japanese-Canadians were interned in centers like this one.  This site is not only a garden, but also a museum and memorial site.  Parts of the movie,Snow Falling on Cedarswas filmed here.  The designer of the garden was a former internee at the Rosebery camp, approximately 3km north of New Denver.  The site also has a bookstore/gift shop",

        "JGarden Description:": "Located near Victoria's Gorge Waterway.  Recently restored.This is a much larger facility than just the Japanese garden.  There are several specialty gardens here including roses, herbs, a winter garden, rhododendron garden, heather garden and dahlia trial garden.  The HCP is located north of the City of Victoria, near Victoria's Gorge Waterway in Saanich, near Elk Lake, just off West Saanich Rd (17A).The Japanese garden at HCP was built with the support of the Takata Japanese Garden Society.  The president at the time, Bob Clarke, has since become the curator and design coordinator.  Volunteers help to maintain the garden by gathering on Wednesday and Saturday for work sessions.  The garden includes two large ponds with a connecting stream, an arched bridge, ayatsu-hashi(zig-zag) bridge, an entrance gate, stone lanterns, and plant material.The Japanese garden has been so successful that the HCP is recently finished akaresansuidry garden on a nearby 40' x 60' plot.  A tea garden is being planned next.Donations may also be sent to Zen Garden Fund, c/o H.C.P.History(from the web site)The Horticulture Centre of the Pacific was created in 1979 when the province of British Columbia issued a \"Certificate of Incorporation\" No. S15136 to a group of 25 citizens from Victoria who had applied for permission to create a not-for-profit society with the following aims:To create The Pacific Demonstration Garden to promote demonstrations and education for gardeners.To create The Pacific Horticultural Training Centre to provide various theoretical and practical training for employees in the field of horticulture.To create The Pacific Horticultural Centre including Canada Hall to provide an internal forum for cultural exchange.An initial grant of $75,000 was used to commission a study of the feasibility of the project. The resulting report concluded that the concept was financially viable, and recommended a parcel of Crown Lands in Saanich as a suitable site. Armed with this information the board of directors of the newly created organization made a presentation to the Provincial Government asking for a grant of Crown Lands in Saanich as well as a direct grant of $250,000 as seed money. At the same time a fund-raising campaign was begun for the estimated $5 million which would be required to launch the project, using the prospect of government support as an incentive for corporate donors. By 1982 it was clear that the provincial government was unwilling to provide both land and money, offering instead a long-term lease at a nominal charge and no grant of money. This situation, combined with a recession, made fund-raising very difficult and continued development of the Centre was uncertain.Meanwhile, memberships in the society were being sold and a cadre of committed volunteers was busy clearing the site and mapping out prospective gardens. Over the next few years gardens were developed using donated services and labour from supporters in the community. During this period a noteworthy development was the creation of the Doris Page Winter Garden with active support of the Victoria Horticultural Society. This garden has continued to develop and is now a featured attraction at HCP with more than 500 examples of plant material suitable for a winter garden in this climatic zone (8). More recent developments are the Takata Japanese Garden and the establishment of an internationally recognized trail garden for dahlias. Many other specialty gardens (heather, rhododendron, herb and fuchsia, for example) have been created.With help from much of the local gardening community, the gardens are continuing to expand. Currently HCP, with a membership of about 1300, operates a training school for maintenance gardeners, maintains about 15 acres of demonstration",

Devised by Colonel William Hall-Walker (later Lord Wavertree), a wealthy Scotsman of a famous brewery family and laid out by the Japanese Eida and his son Minoru. The Gardens, planned to symbolize the 'Life of Man', are now of international renown and are considered some of finest Japanese gardens in Europe.Eida remained at Tully until 1912. He and his wife and two sons, Minoru and Kaiji, lived at Curragh House, which is now the Racing Apprentice Centre of Education. The name Minoru which means 'light of my eye' or the 'favourite one' was chosen by Colonel Hall-Walker for his favourite Tully-bred colt. When leased to King Edward VII for his racing career the colt Minoru carried the royal colours to victory in the Derby of 1909 to joyous cheers of \"Good Old Teddy\"!Eida died in 1912 on his intended return journey to Japan and no more was heard of him or his family until Brian Eida, a son of Minoru, turned up as a tourist to admire the work of his grandfather Tassa.In 1915, Colonel Hall-Walker departed to England, presenting his entire Tully property to 'The Nation'. His Stud Farm became the British National Stud and the Japanese Gardens entered a period of relative obscurity until 1945. In that year (Tully properties having returned to the Irish Government in 1943) the Irish National Stud Company was formed. In the following year, 1946, after a gap of 34 years, the Japanese Gardens got a horticultural supervisor.The symbolism of life, the garden portrays and traces the journey of a soul from Oblivion to Eternity and the human experience of its embodiment as it journeys by paths of its own choice through life. Typical ambitions toward education, marriage, or a contemplative or carefree life, achievement, happy old age and a gateway to Eternity are portrayed.The gardens are visited by more than 100,000 people annually.Refreshments available. Gift shop. Plants for sale. Toilet facilities. Admission charged to gardens, Irish National Stud and Horse Museum.\"Normally gardens consult the genius of place in their design but at Tully the local countryside is excluded and the visitor enters an environment that exudes the mystical and botanical world of distant Japan. One of the most successful gardens of its kind, Tully is a product of the Edwardian vogue for Japanese garden making which developed as part of a movement away from the English garden and in response to a rage for autumn colour and a ready availability of a wide variety of maples.\"BUS: On Weekdays leaves Central Bus Station - BUSARAS at 9.30 a.m.RETURN JOURNEY FROM JAPANESE GARDENS - BUS leaves at 3.45. p.m.TRAINS: The ARROW runs from HEUSTON STATION, Kingsbridge to KILDARE TOWN about every 35 minutes.ROADS: From DUBLIN you take the N7 SOUTH for LIMERICK/CORK.

A series of concentric paths leads the visitor around the garden which features a pagoda, stone lanterns and several bridges over a stream. The inner circles suggest a discovery of our inner selves, while the outer circles, which run along the upper part of the garden, provide a greater knowledge of the world around us. Planting in this area includes Japanese Maples, Azaleas and Chinese Fortune Palms (Trachycarpus Fortunei).Also close to the Japanese Garden is a facinating 18th century grotto made of fossilised sphagnum moss.\"",

Thanks to her six lucrative marriages, she became very wealthy and devoted much of her later life to the construction of the gardens on this site, spending millions of dollars and forty years to build it out.  Lotusland is a 37-acre botanic garden located in the foothills of Montecite east of Santa Barbara.  The Japanese-inspired garden at Lotusland is said to have been Ganna Walska's favorite sub-garden.  It was inspired by her love of the culture and her favorite opera, Madame Butterfly.The Ganna Walska Lotusland Foundation was established by Madame Walska to assume ownership of the property and operation of the estate after her death. The Foundation\u2019s goal is to preserve and enhance the plant collections, foster an increased knowledge of the rare plants at Lotusland, and contribute to conservation efforts world wide.In order to preserve the estate character of the site as well as protect the rare plants housed there, tours of the site are limited.

The garden, designed and constructed by Japanese artisans, is located one mile from the campus in Bel-Air.  The garden includes antique carvngs, a main gate, teahouse, bridges, koi pond and a shrine.  Staff and volunteers lead tours for schools, garden clubs, campus departments and other interested groups.The garden was donated to the university in 1965 by Edward W. Carter, then Chairman of the Regents of the University of California.  It was created in 1961 by Mr. And Mrs Gordon Guiberson in memory of his mother, Ethel Guiberson, who had organized the Beverly Hills Garden Club.  The Guibersons, already knowledgable about Kyoto's gardens, hired Nagao Sakuai to design it.  Many features were brought from Japan and reassembled on site.  In addition, much of the stone for the design cam from Santa Paula Canyon in Ventura County.The garden was seriously damaged by floods in 1969, but reconstruction financed by the Friends of the UCLA Gardens and designed by Dr. Kawana, restored the garden to its original glory.BibliographyBenson, Sheila. \"Japanese Garden . . .

        "JGarden Description:": "Located 1/10 mile from the Village of Saratoga the Hakone Gardens are said to be the oldest Japanese-style residential gardens in North America.  They lie on a superb eighteen acre site nestled in the verdant hills of Saratoga.The Hakone gardens were originally developed by Oliver and Isabel Stine, who purchased the site in 1915 in order to build a summer retreat.  The 1915 Pan-Pacific Exhibition inspired Isabel Stine to travel to Japan for ideas.  The garden was named after the Fuji-Hakone National Park, one of her favorite places.The Stines retained Tsunematsu Shintani of Wakayama (1877-1921) to design the Moon Viewing House and Naoharu Aihara (1870-1941) to do the gardens.  Aihara was descended from a line of Imperial gardens based Koyobashi, Tokyo.The garden is sits on a hillside with a view of Silicon Valley (then knonas the \"Valley of Heart's Delight\").  The overall design approach called for an Upper House and Lower House with a hill and pond garden weaving them together.  The work was done in thesansoor country villa style popular in the late Edo period.  The Upper House, with its dramatic views, was aligned for moon viewing and was finished in 1917.  It is designed as a rustic, shoin style teahouse with a study andtokonoma.  The Lower House was completed in 1922.  It is somewhat more elaborate with redwood frame and wood siding.All of the garden and achitectural elements were constructed to the highest standards.  The Ms. Stine brought the finest craftsmen from Japan and this remains an outstanding example of Meiji era garden art.The property was sold to Major C.L. Tilden, an East Bay financier, in 1932.  His only contribution was the addition of a large main gate to the gardens.  Through the war and subsequent years, the garden was not maintained at the same level and by 1966 had fallen into a state of neglect.  The City of Saratoga rescued it from subdivision and hired Tanso Ishihara, a Kyoto garden builder, to restore the garden.  He added some new elements, such as the Camelia garden and trails.  He repaired the pond, waterfalls and pathway, and heavily pruned the garden.  In collaboration with Kiyoshi Yasui, the architect fo the Imperial Household Agency responsible for the restoration of Katsura, he created a master plan for expanding the gardens to fill the entire 18-acre site.Ishihara died in an accident in 1980, ending his opportunity to implement the master plan.  Friends in Japan and the United States, however, formed a team to see the plan fulfilled.  Yasui, in particular, was instrumental in the formation of the Japan Bamboo Society and a Sister City relationship between Saratoga and Muko, Yasui's home town.  Since then, the Bamboo Park [Kizuna-En] (1987), the Cultural Exchange Center (1990) and the tea plantation (1995) have been completed.  In 1991 a reproduction of a 19th century Kyoto tea merchant's home and shop was added to the site. This structure was built in Japan using traditional methods and tools (no nails), disassembled and reconstructed on site by visiting artisans from Japan. This building contains a tea museum, a traditional tea service area, and is used for cultural and artistic events, weddings, and business meetings.   A student that had studied with Ishihara in Kyoto, Jack Tomlinson, was appointed Japanese Garden Specialist and has overseen the maintenance of the garden in the years since.Many of the more mature plants at Hakone -- the Japanese Maples, Hinoki Cypress, Black Pines and other conifers -- were part of the original plants imported from Japan in 1915-1917 by Mr. N. Aihara, the designer of Hakone, who was employed the Stines. The large speciman Oaks, Madrone, California Laurel and Redwoods were on the property and utilized in the design of the Garden. The slopes surrounding the Garden contain an array of native plant material such as California Holly, C",

        "JGarden Description:": "Begun in 1911, this is one of America's oldest and most mature Japanese gardens.Things Japanese were fascinating to many Americans in the early years of the 20th century.  Since the appearance of Commodore Perry's black ships in Japan in 1868, small amounts of information about Japanese culture began to trickle out to the rest of the world.  In continental Europe, Japanese painting, textiles, prints, design and architecture had a profound impact in the worlds of art and design, culminating in the Japonisme movement near the end of the century.  The Impressionists, Tolouse Latrec, Klimt and the other Art Nouveau artists in Austria and Paris, and numerous others experienced profound shifts in their thinking when they encountered what was, for them, a fresh new culture from Asia.\r\n\r\nThe cultural influence was felt much more gradually on the other side of the Atlantic.  But by early in the 20th Century, there had been several international expositions in Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco and St. Louis.  Each of these expos had Japanese pavilions and gardens at which the Americans marveled.\r\n\r\nSeveral significant books also appeared in America at the end of the 19th century or early in the new century, stirring the national imagination.  Edwin Morse publishedJapanese Homes and their Surroundingsin 1886.  This book influenced two Pasadena architects, Greene and Greene, to create a new aesthetic of architectural structure related to the landscape that had enormous impact on the architectural style of southern California. Josiah Conder's book,Japanese Gardening in Japan, published in 1893, was also enormously influential.As a result of these contact and several other factors, Japanese gardens became the height of fashion in Los Angeles, for those who could afford them.  Many were small tea gardens, but in the Los Angeles area, two were built before 1910 that were the size of a large estate.  One was  by Myron Hunt, Huntington's own architect.  A second was by George T. Marsh, proprietor of the famouse tea garden at the 1894 San Francisco exposition.  When he returned to Pasadena, he decided to build a commercial tea garden in Pasadena.  The effort was extravagent and Marsh spared no expense.Thus, by 1910, Huntington and Hertrich had two local examples, all of the work being done by Greene and Greene and some books on the subject. (An original copy of the Conder book was found in Hertrich's library).  They began to get ideas of their own for a Japanese garden on the grounds of the Huntington estate.  It's not clear, but there may have been some other motivations as well.  Huntington seemed to be in a great hurry to get the garden built by 1912, when he occupied the residence.  It is possible that he may have intended the garden as a gift for his bride and second wife, Arabella, whom he married in 1913.In any case, Huntington and Hertrich set about looking for a site.  They settled on a small, former reservoir, overgrown with brush, on the west side of the San Marino Ranch.  Huntington went to see Marsh, the proprietor of the Pasadena tea garden, about buying some plant material.  It was a fortuitous inquiry for both of them.  Marsh's commercial garden venture was failing financially.  Huntington, who by this time had already bought entire estates and libraries, offered to purchase the whole garden.  Marsh accepted quickly.  In 1911, Huntington started a massive earth-moving effort, shifting the entire Marsh site to the chosen reservoir site. This required dismantling Marsh's Japanese-style house, balling plants, stone and ornaments and then reassembling the entire palette.  Hertrich designed and supervised construction of the whole affair.  In addition to what was acquired from Marsh, he hired Japanese craftsmen to build a bridge and pavilion for a huge bronze temple bell.  As the ornaments fro",

        "JGarden Description:": "This garden had its beginnings as part of a Japanese Village exhibit for the 1894 California Midwinter International Exposition in San Francisco.  Since then it has weathered many changes, including the banishment to internment camps in 1942 of the family who had given the garden to the city and cared for it since its creation.  It is the oldest Japanese-style garden in the United States.The five-acre stroll garden contains a rather eclectic collection of sub-gardens, buildings and artifacts, many with fascinating stories.  Some of its prominent features are a high drum bridge (taiko-bashi), a five-story red pagoda, a dry landscape garden (karesansui), a chain of ponds, a teahouse, a large bronze Buddha (cast in 1790 and presented to the garden by S.&G. Gump Company in 1949) and numerous lanterns and other fixtures.Several people were involved in the design and construction of the original garden, but the most credit is certainly due to Baron Hagiwara Makoto, a prominent Japanese landscape designer who lived at, built, bankrolled and cared for the site from 1895 until his death in 1925.  His son-in-law, daughter and grandchildren continued in his footsteps until 1942.A very sad chapter in the history of the garden ensued, with its caretakers evicted and name changed to the more politically acceptable \u201cOriental Tea Garden.\u201d  Many of the structures built and owned by the Hagiwaras were destroyed, one important building was downgraded to a gift shop, and Baron Hagiwara\u2019s Shinto Shrine was removed.  Some incongruity was introduced at this time when a Buddhist pagoda was moved into the shrine enclosure so that the Shintotoriigate faces the pagoda instead of a shrine, as it should.After the war the garden was eventually renamed \u201cJapanese Tea Garden\u201d and various improvements were undertaken, including the addition in 1953 of the 9,000-pound Lantern of Peace, donated on behalf of the children of Japan, and the construction of the Zen Garden by Sakurai Nagao.  Mr. Sakurai was also commissioned to redesign the entire pond area in front of the teahouse in 1960.Another major redevelopment began in 1965 when a large collection of dwarf trees, lanterns and stones originally belonging to the Hagiwaras was returned to the garden.  The Hagiwaras had entrusted the items to a friend when they were interned in 1942.  Many other projects followed in the ensuing years, including a new landscape with Mt. Fuji as the main theme which was designed by E.J. Schuster in 1979, and the restoration of three aging gates by Kawata Kensuke, one of Japan\u2019s leading temple and shrine builders, in 1985.  The garden has also been the recipient of numerous gifts of statuary and artifacts.Hagiwara Makoto and his family were finally honored in 1974 with the erection of a large stone and bronze plaque designed and made by sculptress Ruth Asawa.  The San Francisco Recreation & Park Department, which has maintained the garden since 1942, named the road bordering the garden Hagiwara Tea Garden Drive in 1986 to further honor the garden\u2019s original benefactors.Theweb site for Golden Gate Parkincludes a 360 degree panorama of the garden.BibliographyBrown, Kendall H. \"Rashomon: the multiple histories of the Japanese Tea Garden at Golden Gate Park\".Studies in the History of Gardens and Designed Landscapes. vol 18 no 2 (April-June 1998), pp 93-119.Ishihara Tanso and Wickham, Gloria.The Japanese Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park 1893-1942.

        "JGarden Description:": "Considered to be the largest single-operated cemetery in the world, Rose Hills consists of approximately 1,400 acres and offers a complete range of funeral services.The Early YearsRose Hills began in 1914 as a small cemetery, consisting of 18 acres of whatwas once part of the famous Rancho Paso de Bartolo Spanish land grant. At that time, Rose Hills was called Whittier Heights Memorial Park and served as the local burial grounds for Whittier. Not long after the park's founding, cemetery management realized that more land was needed and purchased an additional 100 acres. However, the community the cemetery served was growing so rapidly that the additional acreage was not adequate to meet the needs of the densely populated Los Angeles and Orange County areas.In 1928, the management launched an expansion program designed to increase the size of the cemetery through a series of land acquisitions. The program, continuing into the 1950s, increased Rose Hills' land holdings to its present size of approximately 2,500 acres. During this time, the cemetery's directors felt a name change was needed in order to better represent the expanded region the cemetery served. A community-wide contest was held in order to find the most appropriate name, and Rose Hills was selected.Moving MountainsEven with an organized plan for expansion, the going was not always easy. The largest obstacle in the path of Rose Hills' progress was the redesigning of huge amounts of land so that the expansion plan could go forward.Much of the land purchased for the program consisted of rugged hillsides, steep cliffs, and deep canyons. In order to utilize what was considered worthless property, the management of Rose Hills launched one the of the largest private land redevelopment projects ever undertaken.To reshape the terrain into gently sloping hillsides, approximately 25 million cubic yards of earth had to be moved and contoured. By the time the land conversion project was completed, Rose Hills redesigned an amount of earth about one-sixth the size of the Panama Canal.From the 605 Freeway, exit at Rose Hills Road. Travel east to Workman Mill Road, then left to the Rose Hills Memorial Park entrance.",

        "JGarden Description:": "The Shinzen Friendship Garden is located on a 5 acre site within Woodward Park in Fresno, California.The original idea for a Japanese garden arose when Woodward Park was first being developed in 1967.  The concept was seen as a symbol of the sister-city relationship with Kochi-shi, Japan.  Ben Nakamura let the Shinzen Friendship Garden Committee, seeking support form the local Japanese-American community as well as from Japan.Paul Saito, a landscape architect in Los Angeles, and Nakagawa Shiro, a teahouse designer from Japan, were selected to do the design work.  The designs were completed in 1974 and ground was broken the following year.  Extensive land sculpting was necessary with 30,000 cubic yards of earth and 600 tons of granite moved ont he site.  The design includes streams, waterfalls, seven bridges, a koi pond, extensive plantings, and pathways.  The design concept involved breaking the garden into four sections, one for each season with appropriate plantings clustered in each.The work required several years and the garden was not completed until 1981.  The original garden committee was incorporated as a non-profit organization (Shinzen Garden Committee) with the City of Fresno owning the site and responsible for its maintenance.  The teahouse plan was executed in 1989.  It was built in Japan and re-assembled by Japanese carpenters on the shore of the pond.  Over the years, several other improvements and additions have been made including: shelters, an iron fence, a pond deck, signage, anazumayaand a pathway.  The work continues and the garden committee has extensive plans for the future.The garden holds several annual events including a spring blossom festival,toro nagashi, running race, culture fair and artist events.",

        "JGarden Description:": "This 6.5-acre garden is a traditional-style stroll garden like those built in 18th and 19th century Japan for feudal lords.  It also incorporates a dry garden (karesansui), a tea garden with 4.5-mat teahouse and ashoin-style building.  Other features include a zigzag bridge and a naturalistic, three-stage waterfall.  The garden is designed for four-season enjoyment and includes plantings of azaleas, cherry trees, magnolias, wisteria, iris and lotus.The designer of this garden, the lateKawana Koichi, said the main theme of the garden is to show the public how reclaimed water can be used.  Located directly adjacent to a $75 million wastewater treatment plant which generates 65 million gallons of reclaimed water each day, this garden certainly proves its point.  The garden is available for a fee for weddings and other private gatherings.Los Angeles City Engineer Donald C. Tillman was responsible for the original concept of a combination wastewater treatment facility and garden, and he continued to lobby for funds to build the garden when that part of the project was shelved after the treatment plant had been completed.  The City of Los Angeles finally allocated $3 million for the project in 1979, and the garden was built from 1980 to 1983 and dedicated in 1984.  Dr. Kawana passed away in 1990 and a pavilion honoring him is planned for the future.BibliographyDe Wolfe, Evelyn. \" Japanese Garden Uses Reclaimed Water.\"Los Angeles Times.

        "JGarden Description:": "The Shofu-en (lit. 'garden of the pine wind') is a two-acre garden designed byKawana Koichiand dedicated in August 1978. The core features of the garden are the specimen pines, collected and donated to the garden by the Denver Bonsai Club (some of whom later formed the Rocky Mountain Bonsai Society), and the large boulders, collected from the nearby Rocky Mountains.  The skeleton of the garden was built around 800 tons of rock chosen from the mountains near Golden and Loveland.  They were placed to represent mountains and cliffs by the sea.  The 125 ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa), also from the region, form the next layer of the design.  Large swaths of green turf are interrupted by deciduous trees and shrubs, usch as cutleaf weeping birch (Betula pendula; maples (Acer rubrumandA. Ginnala); redleaf Japanese barberry (Berberis thumbergi); flowering cherry (Pyrus calleryana); bugle weed (Ajuga reptans); multi-coloredIris ensata(growing along the stream); and several varieties of thyme (Anarcharisprovide seasonal color and interest.The garden is patterned on thechisen-kaiyushikitemplate (lit. pond and stroll garden).  A walking path meanders through the garden around a central pond with several points of interest interrupting the walk.  Three small islands in the pond represent the usual crane (the largest), tortoise and treasure ship, symbols found in many gardens of this type.There are five stone lanterns, each of them emphasizing a specific view.  The largest and most significant is ayukimi-doroor 'snow-viewing lantern' located near the pond and donated by Denver's sister city, Takayama-shi as a symbol of goodwill and friendship. A second Katsuga style lantern was donated by Takayama in 1964 and was 200 years old at the time.  The other lanterns are on the eastern pathway, at the tea house and near the wisteria arbor (anoribe-doro).A wisteria arbor (two vines, white and lavender, donated by Takayama in fall 1981) is located in the nortwest corner of the garden.  It was placed here as a stopping point along the path.  A square-shapedkesagatawater basin is also located nearby.  It is a replica of the water basin atGinkakuji, in Kyoto.  A tea house is located in the opposite, northeast corner.  It was built by the Kumo Construction Company from Nagano-ken, Japan.  The building was built in Japan, disassembled, numbered, shipped and reassembled in Denver.  Hirabayashi Toshitame, President of the company, and eight Japanese co-workers built the structure in about two weeks.  The cost of the teahouse was covered by a grant from the Weckbaugh Trusts.  The slope of the roof mirrors the sweep of the pine branches and the parallel lines were apparently indended to emphasize the other straight lines of fences, walls and hedges.  A second water basin is arranged as atsukubainear the tea house to provide the ritual hand rinsing prior to the tea ceremony.  A final features is ataikobashior drum bridge near a section of the pond.The garden is screened from the other parts of the botanic garden by scrims of bamboo fencing on the north, west and east sides.  The garden has two entrances and the scenes unfold quite differently depending on which direction one takes.The full botanic garden is quite extensive, covering a 22 acre site.  It  includes a conservatory, greenhouse, visitor's center, gift shop, restaurant, reception area and meetings room.  The garden does host weddings and conferences.  Other gardens include: rose, herb, rock, xeriscape, high plains, alpine, and lilacs.In 2002,Sadafumi Uchiyamawas recommended as project designer for a renovation of the 35-year old garden.

        "JGarden Description:": "This former home of philanthropist Marjorie Merriweather Post, heiress of the Post cereal fortune, is now a museum. It features one of the most comprehensive assemblages of imperial Russian fine and decorative arts outside Russia, and an extensive collection of eighteenth-century French works of art. The twenty-five acre estate is in the heart of Washington, D.C. and includes twelve acres of estate and thirteen acres of woodlands with important azalea (3,000 specimens) and orchid (1,600 specimens) collections.According to the Hillwood Museum's web site, Myaida's garden at Hillwood is one of the last remaining examples of gardens influenced by the reintroduction of the Japanese culture to America during the 1950s. Shogo J. Myaida was a garden designer who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in the 1920s during the first wave of Japanese cultural influence in North America. Myaida was known for a style of garden design that married the best of American pragmatism and Japanese aesthetics.Myaida's goal was not to design a mimetic copy of a garden in Japan, but rather to create a 'Japanese-influenced' garden that fulfilled the requirements set by the owner. Despite his lack of obsession with authenticity, the layout of the Hillwood garden nonetheless interprets a traditional hill and pond garden with a miniaturization of a mountain landscape including a stream cascading from an evergreen forest and then pouring into a series of ponds connected by streams and waterfalls before it ends in a lake at the bottom. More than 500 stones have been placed construct a mountainous landscape.  Paths cross through the garden and wood or stone bridges are interspersed to allow movement across the water elements.  Other elements include pagodas, stone lanterns and statuary placed as the object to important views in the garden. Vegetation includes:cryptomeria,flowering cherries, azaleas and rhododendrons,Japanese maples, and pines.  Native plants are mixed with the Japanese plants and help to create a transition with the woods at the garden's edge. The pond hostslotusand waterlilies andJapanese irislining the edges.The Japanese garden underwent a $2 million renovation byZEN Associatesof Massachusetts.  The project was intended to restore the garden to its condition in the 1960's.  The original Myaida Shogo deisgn had developed a leaky pond and overgrown shrubs and trees had obscurred the original intent.  In order to repair the garden, the 500 boulders were numbered and removed in order to replace the pond liner and pumps.",

        "JGarden Description:": "OverviewThe Morikami Museum and Gardens is considered the only museum in the United States dedicated to the living culture of Japan.  This exceptional cultural site was made possible by George Morikami and is owned and operated by the Palm Beach County Department of Parks and Recreation.  At the beginning of the 20th century, Morikami left Miyazu, Japan with a group of fellow emigrants to establish a farming colony called Yamato in Boca Raton, Florida.  The community did not survive, but Morikami remained in Florida as a farmer and businessperson.  In 1977 he bequeathed 200 acres of land to Palm Beach County and the State of Florida to honor his fellow colonists and both their original and adopted homelands.Today, the Museum includes both permanent and changing exhibitions on Japan and related cultural topics, the Yamato-kan villa, sculptures, bonsai collections, gardens, pavilions, cafe, museum store, the Donald B. Gordon Memorial Library, IBM Infotronic Gallery, annual festivals and nature trails.  Performances and film series are held in a 225-seat theatre.  Tea ceremonies are held in a dedicated tea house,Seishin-an.  The institution also sponsors classes and workshops inorigami,bonsai,ikebana,haiku,sumi-epainting, orchid cultivation, Japanese language, photography, kite-making and other topics.Phase OnePhase One of the garden included the Yamato-kan pavilion, an historicishidorostone lantern, atsukubai(water basin), bonsai display, Allen S. Austin Memorial Waterfall (designed by Carn Reid), akame shima(turtle island), a Challenger Memorial Lantern, Yamato Island, the Morikami Falls, the Wisdom Ring, a dry creek garden and part of the seven-acre lake.  Phase One was completed in December 1999 and opened shortly thereafter.The Yamato-kan, located on Yamato Island, was the original site of the Morikami Museum building but now houses an exhibit on the colony of Japanese farmers for which it is named.  It is designed to give visitors a sense of the size and layout of a traditional Japanese farm house.Theishidorolantern was originally erected in 1681 at Toshogu Shrine in Edo as a memorial to Ietsuna, the fourth Tokugawa shogun.  It was later moved to a shipbuilding company in Kure and then later to a ship owner in West Palm Beach.  From there it found its way to the South Florida Science Museum and finally to the Morikami in 1977.The Challenger Memorial was dedicated to the seven Challenger astronauts, one of whom was Ellison Onizuka, the first person of Asian descent to travel into space.  The Kasuga-style stone lantern is on the northwestern tip of Yamato Island.The Wisdom Ring  is located west of the current main museum building.  It is a replica of a stone lantern (ishidoro) located in Delray Beach's sister city in Japan, Miyazu, where it is the town symbol.  The original Wisdom Ring (chie no wa) stands on the grounds of a temple dedicated to Monju, the Buddhist bodhisattva of wisdom.  This replica was given to the Museum by the citizens of Miyazu to commemorate the institution's 20th anniversary in 1997.Phase TwoThe Morikami Museum and Gardens opened the second phase of its Japanese gardens on January 9, 2001.  The six new gardens had been under construction for the previous 18 months and opened with events that included taiko drumming, origami, calligraphy, bonsai, ikebana and tea ceremonies.  Officially now known as the George D. and Harriet W. Cornell Gardens, the $3.5 million project covers 16 of the site's 200 acres and is now one of the largest Japanese-inspired gardens in the world.The new gardens, designed by Hoichi Kurisu, are intended to represent six periods of Japanese garden history.  The Shinden Gardens are designed after the Heian period (9th - 12th centuries) aristocratic<",

In the 1950's, Mr. Kiyoshi Ichimura became enamored with the City of Miami and began sending dismantled objects and materials from Tokyo along with carpenters, gardeners and a landscape architect to design and construct, what in 1961 would become, the \"San-Ai-An Japanese Garden.\"Beginning in Fall 2001, the site upon which it was located was converted to a new facility for the Tropical Parrot Garden that had previously been located in downtown Miami.The Japanese garden has been reduced in size and was moved to an adjacent 1 acre site, where it was restored.  The City of Miami and landscape architect Lester Collins Pancoast and architect Thorn Grafton worked cooperatively with the Japanese Consul and The Friends of the Japanese Garden to redesign and reconstruct the Ichimura Miami-Japan Garden.  It was re-opened in 2006.This garden is located on the Miami end of the MacArthur Causeway, on Watson Island, the extension of I-395 that connects Miami to Miami Beach.A charitable fund has been established at the Dade Community Foundation to support the completion of this project.Dade Community Foundation200 South Biscayne Boulevard Suite 505Miami, FL 33131-2343Telephone: 305-371-2711Fax: 305-371-5342",

        "JGarden Description:": "This garden was originally reported to JGarden as including a Japanese garden, but in truth, it does not. However, it remains in the JGarden database for its age, the quality of its maintenance, the light it sheds on the motivations behind the construction of such gardens in the early 20th century and for the intriguing way in which it has been adapted to meet the needs of the local community.The Society of the Four Arts was founded in 1936 by a group of Palm Beach residents who perceived a need for cultural institutions that had heretofore been absent from the community, and it remains today the premier arts organization in a community that now boasts several museums, libraries and other public arts groups.  It was founded in the middle of the Great Depression to encourage the appreciation of art music, theatre and literature by mounting of exhibitions; hosting concerts, lectures and film; and the establishment of a public lending library.  The original building was designed by local architect, Maurice Fatio and now houses the Four Arts Library.  It is now just one among several structures that occupy two city blocks.  The gardens adjoin this library building in a walled space that is bordered by Royal Palm Way and Four Arts Square.  Other attractions on the Four Arts grounds include a Gallery building that hosts art exhibits, lectures and films; a sculpture;  and a palm-lined mall centered on a Noguchi sculpture.The Four Arts Gardens were built in 1938 as demonstration gardens to display the diversity of landscape possibilities available to homeowners in the tropical climate of South Florida.  The seven Four Arts members responsible for creating these gardens were also members of the Palm Beach Garden Club.  The constructed Tropical Fruit; Chinese (Mrs. Lorenzo Woodhouse); Fragrant Moonlight; Spanish Patio; British Colonial; Florida Jungle; and Formal Rose gardens.  Each themed garden is accented with an appropriate facade or statuary to indicate the architectural style with which it was intended to be watched.  The gardens are arranged into interlocking courtyards with the Chinese Garden being the most prominent.In 1954 landscape architect, Richard K. Webel prepared a master plan that substantially altered teh intent of the gardens.  Over the next several years, the separate parts of the garden were gradually replanted to weave together a single, larger garden.  This remained the case until the 1990's when the Four Arts made a decision to return to the original intent of small demonstration gardens to assist local homeowners with their own garden design projects.  The gardens have therefore reversed their trend toward integration to some extent, though this remains a relatively mature tropical garden that highlights a plethora of specimen plants.  It is a quiet place, appropriate for its location next to a library and offers several pleasant reading benches.  The Chinese and 'Jungle' gardens are the most interesting.  The former is dominated by a stone-line pond a fountain bisected by a stone bridge and stocked withkoi.  The latter is perhaps the most 'Japanese' in appearance with stone paths and isolation from the other, more open courtyards.  The whole site in filled with interesting specimens including: bamboo, palms, phylodenddron, bromeliads and huge 'sausage tree' (Kigelia pinnate) from Africa.While there, I was told by some Palm Beach locals that the gardens and library were recently threatened by construction of a shopping mall.  Local residents objected, and the site is safe, at least for now.The gardens are located about five minutes from I-95.  Take the Okeechobee Blvd East exit (52A) toward Palm Beach.  Take Okeechobee across the Intercoastal Waterway, where it turns into Royal Palm Way.  Four Arts Plaza is just past the bridge, on the left.Please note that winter is high season here, with most of the e",

        "JGarden Description:": "While the Japanese Garden is now part of the Atlanta Botanical Garden, its origin actually pre-dates the founding of the botanical garden.Surrounded on three sides by a wall, built by Japanese artisans, the garden is peaceful and serene. In keeping with Japanese tradition, most of the plants are evergreen, with only a few seasonal accents of vivid color. Visitors will also find \"three old friends\" typical of Chinese and Japanese gardens: pine and/or stone which symbolize longevity and age, bamboo which is symbolic of resilience against all adversity, and blooming fruit trees which represent youth and renewal of life.The moon gate is a design feature that originated in China and has been adopted by the Japanese. Through the moon gate and through the round window of the tea house, a vista to the heart of the Japanese garden may be observed. If you step through the moon gate, the legend says one day you will return to that spot.The pines in the garden are Virginia pines, Pinus virginiana, and trimmed to give the appearance of great age.DirectionsTake I-85/I-75 to Midtown. Exit onto 14th St. and go east. 14th Street deadends into Piedmont Ave. Turn left. ABG's entrance is on the right at the first traffic light.The Atlanta Botanical Garden is adjacent to Piedmont Park on Piedmont Ave. The entrance is at the traffic light between Monroe and 14th St.",

        "JGarden Description:": "The inspiration for Anderson Gardens began in 1966 during John Anderson's first trip to Japan. There he met a family friend, Mr. Akira Ohno, President of Morinaga Milk Industries of Tokyo, who gave him an in-depth look at the Japanese people and their culture. When the land was acquired for a new home site, John and Linda Anderson realized that the property had the potential to be an excellent setting for a Japanese garden. With the Andersons' strong interest in Japanese culture, they decided to start development of a Japanese-style garden.Construction of the Anderson Gardens began in 1978. The gardens have been designed and built byHoichi Kurisu. Mr. Kurisu came to the United States in 1968 accepting the position of Director of Landscaping at the Japanese garden complex in Washington Park Gardens, Portland, Oregon. He had graduated from Tokyo's Waseda University and spent several years studying under Mr. Kenzo Ogata, one of Japan's most renowned landscape designers. Mr. Kurisu has his own landscape design and construction firm in Portland.  The garden was recently donated to an area non-profit to be managed.This pond and stroll garden is renowned for its stonework, hidden water features and exceptional carpentry.

        "JGarden Description:": "The Elizabeth Hubert Malott Japanese Garden, also called Sansho-en (literally, Garden of Three Islands) is built on three islands in an artificial lake. The first of the three islands composing the 17.3 acre Malott Japanese Garden is Keiunto (Island of Auspicious Cloud), the largest and highest. In this island's dry garden, gravel represents water and plants symbolize land. On Keiunto, mounds of azaleas cover an entire hillside and are particularly striking when they are in bloom. Shoin House a retreat house of the Edo period, features a moss garden with kesa pattern carved water basin, pond views, and presentations by docents a couple of days a week. Check for the docents' schedule. The second island, Seifuto (Island of Clear, Pure Breezes) is named for the gentle winds that refresh the island. Seifuto features wooded spaces and tranquil views of the other two islands. The third island, Horaijima, beckons from afar and can be appreciated only from a distance. It is the Island of Everlasting Happiness, representing a paradise inaccessible to mere mortals.\r\nDr. Koichi Kawana designed this garden in the kaiyu-shiki, or promenade style developed in Japan in the 17th century. Visitors follow curving paths, a form that allows the garden to reveal itself slowly.Throughout spring and summer, Sansho-en is a lush and beautiful space that uses many shades of green with punctuations of blooms, said senior horticulturist Benjamin Carroll. The autumn color is also very vibrant.  Many visitors admire the garden's softness, silhouettes, and shadows after a winter snow.The entire Chicago Botanic Garden is 385-acres with more than 26 different gardens and several educational greenhouses of interest to all members of the family. Narrated tram tours available. A cafe, gift shop, and ask a Master Gardener service are available in the Visitor Center.",
        "Other Description:": "Construction: A Japanese garden was included in the original plans for the Chicago Botanic Garden. Work began on Sansho-en in the early 1970s to design and build the islands. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the planting was completed. Shoin House and other structures were built and the garden was dedicated in September 1982.In 2006, the Japanese Garden and the Shoin House were rededicated in honor of Elizabeth Hubert Malott who endowed the ongoing operations of this garden.",

        "JGarden Description:": "The Fabyan Villa Museum was the home of George and Nelle Fabyan from 1905 - 1939. It was initially their summer home, while they lived in Chicago, but as their estate grew into a lavish showplace, complete with fountains, swimming pools, a windmill, private zoo, tennis courts, and much more, they decided to make it their permanent residence. In 1907 they hired Frank Lloyd Wright to enlarge and re-model their home. When you visit the Villa Museum you experience Frank Lloyd Wright architecture, as well as the unique and fascinating Fabyan Story. The Museum contains the Fabyans' private collection of Asian artifacts, natural history specimens, Nelle's original Mission-Style bedroom furniture and some surprises!You will learn about the Fabyans' many contributions to society such as being part of the Russo-Japanese Peace Negotiations, involvement in the Bacon/Shakespeare controversy, code-breaking which influenced both World Wars and produced America's most famous Cryptographer, and the generosity they bestowed on residents of the Fox Valley Area.The Japanese Garden, first installed c. 1909, is a tranquil oasis where history melds with nature and theory. This special site affords you the opportunity to simply enjoy a bit of harmony with nature, or to learn how you might add some beauty to your own backyard.",

        "JGarden Description:": "Chicago hosted the Columbia World's Fair and Exposition in 1893.  These world's fairs occured every few years in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and were enormously influential events for the history of art and design as well as for exposing Americans to a range of cultural influences and potential trade partners.  Japan was just emerging on the international stage as an important world power, and it was the first foreign government to commit support to the Columbian Exposition in Chicago.  It gave $500,000 to the Fair and built a replica of thePhoenix Hall (Byodoin) in Ujion Jackson Park's Wooded Island (near the site of the Fair).  This structure, then known as 'Ho-o-den', along with some minor landscape elements, became the core of what is now called the Osaka Garden.The area nearby was re-developed as the 'Japanese Garden' in 1934 as part of the Century of Progress World's Fair.  A tea house, built as part of the garden, was moved to Wooded Island shortly after the end of the Fair.  The Park District also constructed a peninsula, added a Shinto-style gate (torii) and enclosed the site, giving it a more private, garden-like atmosphere.  The Phoenix Hall replica was destroyed by fire in 1944, but the garden continued to be maintained.  The Park District renovated the garden in 1981 and added a waterfall.  The name was changed to 'Osaka Garden' in 1992, to honor Chicago's Sister City.  At that time, the City of Osaka donated $250,000 for some renovations to the garden, including a new entrance gate, built in 1995 byOkumura Designs.Like most Japanese gardens in North America, this is a melange of many influences, including elements of stroll, tea and pond gardens.  The site has ostensibly been layed out as a stroll garden, alternately hiding and revealing its elements as one walks through it.  The visitor enters through the new gate and follows a stone path leading to the tea house (which survived the 1944 fire).  Along the way, one finds meandering streams, the waterfall composition added in 1981 and a small turtle island (kame-shima).  The color scheme is relatively subtle with various shades of green becoming the canvas for the rest of the garden elements.A master plan for repairs and renovation of the garden was prepared in 2001 bySadafumi Uchiyama.  Phase I construction took place in summer 2002 and the garden was officially re-opened in fall 2002.  The Phase I work included reconstruction of th waterfall, pond and lagoon shorelines ($400,000).  The remaining work has continued since then and include: re-alignment of the path system; new plantings; re-construction of tea house; addition of a new tea garden; addition of pavilion at edge of the Lagoon; and construction of new entrance gate (the current one is at the tail end of the garden).This entire area of Chicago has a great deal to offer.  The garden site lies near the Lake Michigan shore and is just a few minutes walk from the Museum of Science and Industry (MSI), the University of Chicago and the DuSable Museum of African-American History.The Garden is now managed by a consortium of partners including The Chicago Park District, \r\nChicago Sister Cities International Program, \r\nThe Chicago Botanic Garden, \r\nThe Master Gardeners Program of the University of Illinois Cooperative Extension, \r\nThe Museum of Science and Industry, and \r\nFriends of the Parks",

        "JGarden Description:": "The garden at the Muscatine Art Center is associated with the Laura Musser Museum, a refurbished home of 1908. The garden was installed by Lauar Musser in 1920 or 1929 (there are conflicting records) and underwent extensive renovation in 1990.Nestled on the shores of the Mississippi River, the Japanese garden consists of a series of waterfalls and ponds along a stream, Torii gate and Japanese bridges and pagodas.  It's recommended that upon arriving at the Muscatine Art Center, you should request to see the 10-15 minute film of one of Laura Musser's famous parties held soon after the Japanese Garden was put in.  Not only does it show how small the trees and shrubs were then (over 75 years ago), it also shows some of the famous Muscatine people of the 1920's dressed in costumes as famous movie stars.  One of the highlights of our original Japanese Garden are the Yews which have grown to 50' tall Tree Form Yews.  The high winds of the Iowa tornado season and the bitter cold winters and heavy snows have recently caused us to loose a few branches from these exotic unique shade trees.  But they are still amazing and keep the top of our waterfall nicely shaded and cool in the summer.  There are several original snow lanterns put in by Laura Musser and a small shrine house which once held a Buddha (though it disappeared in one of several acts of vandalism).Available for weddings.Parking is available on both Mulberry Ave and Cedar St.",

        "JGarden Description:": "This 2.3 acre garden, created by a self-taught landscape designer and owner of the Asticou Inn to preserve for Mt. Desert Island the plants from the Beatrix Farrand estate, displays over 20 varieties of azaleas in a setting that includes a stream, an iris-bordered pond and a meditation garden.  The garden is actually part of what is known as Asticou Terraces, created by Boston landscape architect Joseph Henry Curtis. Many of the existing plants were brought from Reef Point, the shorefront estate of landscape gardener Beatrix Farrand.  After the Bar Harbor fire in 1947, the Farrand property was sold and Charles K. Savage bought the entire collection of plants (including azaleas, rhododendrons, mountain laurels, cedars and hemlocks) from the estate in one lot and divided it between Thuya Gardens and Asticou Gardens with financial assistance from John D. Rockefeller Jr. Other plants have been purchased from growers in Massachusetts in the years since. Today the gardens are owned and maintained by the Island Foundation.  There's more on the history athttp://www.asticou.com/history.html.The garden includes a stream, ponds, bridges, stone paths, a dry garden, stone lanterns, moss and pruned trees.  The head gardener is Mary Roper.If you visit, be sure not to miss nearby Acadia National Park.",

Locally collected rocks were arranged around the tea hut to symbolize seven events in the life of Buddha. The stones themselves have deep meaning: they are millions of years old and have a hidden inner strength.The Japanese garden was proposed in November 1984 by Jill Ker Conway, then president of Smith College. She officiated at the ground-breaking ceremony held on May 4, 1985. The garden was designed by David Slawson, who apprenticed with Nakane Kinsaku, the famous Kyoto landscape artist. Construction took place in June and July of 1986 with the help of the ground crew, carpenters, masons, and painters from the Smith College Physical Plant Department (William Johansen, director) and Botanic Garden (Richard Munson, director). Also contributing to the project were Taitetsu Unno, chair of the garden committee, Marylin Rhie, chair of East Asian studies, and Marilyn Shields, landscape architect. The plantings around the Japanese garden were renewed in spring 1998 in connection with a student Special Studies in Landscape project by Nicole Davignon AC.",

The project, inspired by DuPont's Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, PA, began in 1959 and required a five-year process of experimentation and design to achieve a series of landscapes replicating various classic garden settings from around the world. Duke remained personally involved with the gardens until the mid 1980s, but they have been run by the foundation since her death in 1993.The Japanese section includes a small teahouse, a wood bridge, fuji, azaleas, primrose, crocus; as well as akaresansuidry garden.One-hour tours of the greenhouse display gardens are offered Wednesday through Sunday from September through May, rain or shine.Tours run regularly throughout the day from 10:40 a.m. until approximately 3:15 p.m. with 15 people or less per group.Located on Route 206, 1 3/4 miles south of the Somerville traffic circle.Food, drinks or photography are not allowed in the gardens.",

Built on the grounds of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden from 1914 to 1915 and extensively restored in 1999 and 2000, the garden is highly acclaimed and considered the masterpiece of Japanese landscape designer Takeo Shiota (1881-1943).  It was constructed at a cost of $13,000, a gift of early BBG benefactor and trustee Alfred T. White.The layout of the garden features a combination of elements from the ancient hill-and-pond style and the more modern stroll garden.  A traditional-style viewing pavilion offers a panoramic view of the curved pond, which covers nearly half the site, against a backdrop of man-made mountains ortsukiyama.  An elaborate vermiliontoriigate modeled after the famous one at Miyajima stands in the pond and frames a Shinto shrine on the hill beyond.  The present shrine was built in 1960 to replace the original structure and it features traditional construction techniques, such as the use of wooden pins instead of nails.Next to the shrine, a naturalistic waterfall flows down into an inlet and on toward a traditional turtle island (kame-jima), symbolizing longevity, which is connected to the mainland by a high, rounded wooden drum bridge (taiko-bashi).Several lanterns of various styles grace the garden, including a snow-viewing lantern (yukimi-doro), a Kasuga lantern and an impressive ten-foot high, three-ton, 350-year-old lantern presented to New York in 1980 by its sister city, Tokyo.The garden incorporates plants traditionally used in Japanese gardens, such as Japanese irises, tree peonies, azaleas, maples and flowering cherries, as well as plants native to North America.A pleasant surprise awaits visitors to the garden\u2019s website: the Historic Image Collection contains dozens of photos of the garden during and immediately after construction, featuring shots of carpenters hewing logs, the foundations of the waterfall and the original plantings as well as scenic views and visitors.  The photos date from 1914 to 1916, the 1920s and 1930s and provide tidbits of information for those interested in garden history and construction methods.",

        "JGarden Description:": "From the web site:(rc)A Brief History of the Japanese GardenThe City of Buffalo, New York, is home to many American artistic and architectural treasures including: the Darwin Martin House designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, the Guaranty Office Building designed by Louis Sullivan, the Buffalo Psychiatric Center by H.H. Richardson and Albright-Knox Art Gallery, one of the leading modern art gallery in the nation. In Buffalo, visitors will also find the first park system in America, originally designed Frendrick Law Olmsted in 1870, whose other works include New York's Central Park, Boston Emerald Necklace Parks, Yosemite National Park, San Francisco's Parks System and the Niagara Reservation.The main park in Buffalo's historic Olmsted Parks System is Delaware Park, the focal point of the 1901 Pan American Exposition. Today, Delaware Park serves as Buffalo's primary place for citywide recreation and leisure. Both the Albright-Knox Art Gallery and the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society building are in this park. Delaware Park is an archetypal representation of America's Victorian and industrial era of the late 19th century.The Japanese Garden has become a part of the landscape at the west end of Delaware Park. The design of the garden was conceived in 1970; construction started in 1971 and it was completed in 1974. It originally represented a gesture of friendship between two sister cities, Buffalo and Kanazawa, Japan. Located on six acres along Delaware Park's Mirror Lake, it began with over 1,000 plantings, some lighting, and three small islands connected to the mainland by bridges. It is maintained by the City's Parks Department.Buffalo's artistic and architectural monuments, like Delaware Park, were constructed during the city's wealthy industrial period. As the main financial, transportation and manufacturing center of America's industrial heartland, Buffalo was able to attract this nation's greatest artists, designers, planners and architects to construct prototypical works of the period. Today, the city faces grave economic circumstances. Buffalo's urban core has decayed over the last decades. Many infrastructure necessities have been ruined or neglected, including the city's great parks system and the Japanese Garden.The City of Buffalo, in partnership with the Japanese Group of Buffalo, the Buffalo-Kanazawa Sister City Committee and Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy, is undertaking a redevelopment of its Japanese Garden to both renovate the existing Garden and enhance it, as a part of the \"Adopt-A-Park\" program. The program was initiated by the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy in 1995 and the City of Buffalo Parks Department to encourage people to make a commitment to a nearby park or playground, or one of our historic park areas, and help keep it clean and green.Garden FeaturesThe major features of the Japanese Garden Restoration Project include: a stabilization of the existing islands with new stone and replanting, a replacement of the islands with new stone and replanting, a replacement of the ornamental bridge, a restoration of the paths, a clearing of overgrown vegetation of the upper slopes, a trimming of the existing trees and shrubs, an introduction of a stone garden, a newkaresansuiwaterfall, a replanting of a major stand of Japanese cherry trees, new stone benches, and extensive plantings of trees and shrubs and more.The project has started on July 1995, the design of the Garden has accomplished cooperatively with the Japanese Garden experts at the City of Kanazawa, Japan. Construction begun in the middle of April 1996 and have complected the end of June 1996. The total cost of the beautification project of the Garden is $265,000, of which $96,000 is funded by the Commemorative Association for the Japan World Exposition (1970), Japan, as Japan World Exposition Co",

        "JGarden Description:": "Set on 200 acres in Millbrook, New York,  90 miles north of New York City just off the Taconic Parkway, Innisfree was the private preserve of Walter and Marion Beck from 1929 to 1960.  It is now run by a private foundation.  The garden is a fascinating combination of Chinese, Japanese and American influences.Innisfree is a melange of influences.  The name is Gaelic.  Its design is a mix of Asian, Egyptian and Roman.  It was created by a Quaker.Inspired by Yeats lyric, Innisfree was established in 1930 as the private garden of Walter Beck and his wife, Marion, heiress to a Minnesota mining fortune. The Becks took the name for the garden from the William Butler Yeats poem beginning, \"I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree.\"Innisfree Garden comprises a 180-acre basin                 \r\nof 'naturalized' gardens and woodland surrounding a         \r\npicturesque lake.  Walter Beck, the garden's creator, was   \r\na student of Asian art.  Inspired by the scroll paintings of eighth-century Chinese poet and painter Wang Wei's garden, beginning  in 1930 he worked for 22 years           \r\nstaking out streams, walkways and plantings.  The           \r\nterraces, retaining walls, sculptural groupings of          \r\nnatural rock, waterfalls and planned vistas of the lake     \r\nwere organized to keep elements 'in tension,' or 'in        \r\nmotion.'\"  Beck's design organized the garden into several separate, self-contained landscapes.After Beck's death, Collins continued the work on the garden.  Following the practical directives of theSakuteiki(also known as theSensai Hishoor Secret Garden Book)  Collins incorporated Beck's individual gardens into a larger design that allows the visitor to move gracefully from one scene to the next. By the time he died in 1993, he had doubled the size of an already vast and elaborate private garden that required the services of 20 full-time gardeners, while converting it into a public garden that could be maintained by a staff of five.  While this garden was inspired by Asian art, it has a distinctly North American character.  The plants are entirely native and the stone was taken from the surrounding forest.The Garden was given to the Innisfree Foundation in 1959. In 1960, Innnisfree was opened to the public, as provided for by the Beck's will.  The site is now managed by Petronella Collins, president of the Innisfree Foundation.  Collins is the widow of Lester Collins, the landscape architect who principally designed the gardens and worked there for 40 years.  Other members of the board of trustees include Spencer Davidson, E. Peter Krulewitch, George S. Wislocki, William Metcalfe, Jr. and Oliver Collins.Directions: on Tyrrel Rd. 1 mile from Rt. 44; 2 1/2miles from South Millbrook on Rt. 44, turn left on Tyrrel Rd.; 1 3/4 miles from Taconic Pkwy. overpass on Rt. 44, turn right on Tyrrel Rd.For further reference:Collins, Lester.Innisfree: An American Garden.

        "JGarden Description:": "The Humes Japanese Stroll Garden in Mill Neck, N.Y. is designed on a very sloping 4-acre site of deeply wooded land adjacent to a wild life sanctuary.  The garden was begun in 1960 upon the return of Ambassador and Mrs. Humes from Japan.  They became interested in Japanese gardens, and over the following four years, engaged the services of a Japanese garden designer and his wife.  The garden was given to the Wild Life Sanctuary in 1980 by Ambassador Humes, and his Foundation was started for the purposes of maintenance and preservation.  Upon his death, Ambassador Humes left the garden to the Foundation and the garden opened to the public in 1987.   The Garden Conservancy assumed care, management and preservation in 1993.  The local  Long Island Community has been providing volunteers to assist in maintenance, visitor services and special events.  The garden is one of few northeast examples of traditional Japanese garden design.The garden is a combination of several design concepts and immediately evokes (quite successfully)  the sensation of yamazato,  the transcendent feeling of a deep, remote mountain hamlet.   These design concepts  are conditions that were common of, and quite mandatory  for Japanese garden and landscape design.  There is a scenic representation\r\nof a lake garden (without an 'island') which contains  a water condition dating far back into Heian imperial design (circa 790) in the 'bottle gourd' traditional configuration.  The lake garden is  authentically replicated on a plateau of land midway through the garden, at a point approximately midway up the elevation.  The lake is also pleasantly viewed from the windows of  thecha-shitsu(tea house), so participants in wabi-cha (tea ceremony)  will have meditative surroundings. The house was brought to America by Ambassador Humes and is characteristic of the\r\nshoin-dzukuri form set forth in the Ashikaga period (1300's).  This house is the largest and dominant architectural form within the garden, recessed behind specimen plantings of evergreens, bamboos, and the famed 'tortoise' planting of shrub and rocks (symbolizing longevity)- a very essential element of imperial garden design, as well as an essential element of the calligraphic art of the old masters.  The water of the lake garden religiously evoked a principle tenet of Zen Buddhism:\r\nparadise or eternity was a water garden and was the heavenly abode of Amida (a very benevolent deity).  Along therojiare severalyatsuhashi, which are plank bridges and although these were originally functional, they serve as more transitional spaces within the garden.  Entering from the guests entrance, one passes over theyari-mizu(drawn stream) which winds its way into the garden and the pond.  Aesthetics characteristic of Japanese garden and landscape design relate directly to the Buddhist and Shinto elements of beauty: appreciation of age; impermanence;\r\nimperfection; perishability; simplicity; irregularity; incompleteness: understatement: and mystery.The Japanese stroll gardens have been found in history dating back centuries, and the design elements are extremely different when compared to Western gardens.  There are very specific principles governing all gardens in Japan, be they small tsuboniwa (courtyards), monastic retreats or residential properties, and some of the grander imperial gardens still exist in towns such as Kyoto and Nara.  The primary element of Japanese garden design is symbology, for the garden is a compilation of metaphors based in the religions of Shintoism and Buddhism, where the gods inhabit nature.  The garden was designed to compress the sensory qualities of the natural world into a small space  of land, in most cases, no more than a few hectares.  The design elements conformed to the principles of architecture at th",

The owners, Richard and Alice Angino, built the original 'Oriental' garden with plants purchased from Fred Berman, a horticulturist and collector of rare conifers who passed away in 1978.  In 1979-1980 the couple purchased ten percent of the collection from the Rara Flora Nurseries that Bergman ran.  They then proceeded to turn a cow pasture into a lush garden.  In 1995, they hired landscape architect Harriet Henderson to turn this collection into a Japanese garden.  A red Chinese entry gate was removed and the mix of plantings was replaced with a much simpler scheme that was then surrounded by azaleas.The garden is not open to the public or guests at the resort, but the Angino's sometimes conduct tours on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.

Public transit available on Tri-Met Bus #63.The Japanese Garden is actually a collection of five gardens of distinctive styles smoothly linked and draped across 5.5 acres of varied terrain.  Designed by Professor Takuma Tono in 1963, the garden overlooks Portland and Mount Hood to the east.The Strolling Pond Garden features a naturalistic waterfall and a zigzag bridge weaving through rafts of Japanese irises.The Tea Garden, consisting of inner and outer gardens, contains a teahouse built in Japan with traditional carpentry techniques, as well as amachiaior waiting booth for tea ceremony guests.The Natural Garden meanders down a hillside leading to the Sand and Stone Garden.  The path is graced by peaceful nooks and crannies, various kinds of steps and stepping stones, tiny bridges, rivulets and shallow streams.The Sand and Stone Garden, orkaresansui, is an abstract composition surrounded by a mud-plastered wall similar in style to those often found at Zen temples in Japan.The Flat Garden, with its raked gravel and moss islands shaped like asakecup and gourd, is reminiscent of the garden at Sambo-in in Kyoto.  The garden can be viewed from a deep-eaved event pavilion built in the Kamakura period style.Dozens of season events are held in the garden, including celebrations of Children\u2019s Day (May), Tanabata (July), Obon (August), Moon viewing (September), as well as tea ceremony demonstrations and camellia, rose, iris, chrysanthemum, bonsai and ikebana shows.

        "JGarden Description:": "The site upon which the Japanese House (as it's known to Philadelphians) now stands has had some kind of Japanese structure since the 1876 Centennial Exposition, when the Japanese Bazaar and garden were in the area.After the Centennial Exposition, the site was occupied by a gate of a 17th century Buddhist temple. The gate was transported to the United States for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exhibition in St. Louis and then moved to Philadephia in 1905. It was destroyed by fire in 1955.The Japanese House was built in Nagoya, Japan in 1953. The entire building, designed by Yoshimura Junzou, was presented to the Museum of Modern Art New York by the America-Japan Society of Tokyo for an exhibition held in 1954-55. After its stint in the MoMA courtyard, it was given to the City of Philadelphia and later reassembled at the current site in 1958.  The garden was designed in conjunction with the re-assembly by Sano Tansai.To honor the U.S. Bicentennial, the Japanese government made a grant in 1976 to the City of Philadelphia for extensive repairs to the house and garden. The Friends of the Japanese House and Garden was organized in 1982 to continue the preservation of the site. Repairs and renovations have continued since then as funding becomes available. The most recent funding effort allowed the hinoki roof on the building to be restored.For more details on the history of the garden, there's a reallygreat article by Christeen Taniguchi .The Pine Breeze Villa is located on the grounds of the Horticulture Center, in West Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, near the intersection of Belmont Avenue and Montgomery Drive.By automobile, take the Montgomery Drive exit from I-76 (the Schuylkill Expressway), turn west on Montgomery and take the first left; pass through the gate and follow Horticultural Drive around the greenhouses to the Japanese House. Park behind the Japanese House complex. The Horticulture Center may also be entered from Belmont Avenue by turning east onto Montgomery Drive.By public transportation, take SEPTA bus 38 from Center City or the Wissahickon Transfer Station to the intersection of Belmont Avenue and Montgomery Drive. The Japanese House is a five minute walk down Montgomery from the bus stop, through the iron gates and over the hill to the right.",

Specialty plant collections include: the Glendale Azalea Garden (150 varieties); the Herb Garden (100 species); the Ground Cover garden (28 species); and a Pinetum (over 200 species of conifers).Born in Switzerland in 1903, Arnold Bartschi (1903-1996) came to the United States in the 1920's to work for the Bally Shoe Co., first in the west and then in Philadelphia. By the mid-'30s he was owner of the J. Edwards Shoe Co., manufacturer of children's orthopedic shoes. In 1957 he purchased the 200 acres of the former Llewellyn estate along Charlestown Road, beginning his career of conservation, historic preservation and community involvement.  During the next 30 years he developed the 19-acre Swiss Pines site; set aside the remainder of the tract as a wildlife conservation area, established the 10-acre Nature Center of Charlestown, funding its first year of operation; purchased many of the properties in Charlestown Village including the General Store and the Baughman farm, site of Charlestown's original mill. With the help of the French & Pickering Trust, all of Charlestown Village was placed on the National Register. Arnold and Meta Bartschi, the founders of the garden, donated the site to a foundation in 1960.",

        "JGarden Description:": "The Japanese Garden in Hermann Park is operated by the City of Houston, Parks and Recreation Department and was created by the efforts of American and Japanese businesses with grants from many foundations and individuals. The City of Houston donated the land and helped with the construction. It is a symbol of friendship between this country and Japan.This particular garden is a daimyo style, and includes a tea garden, a kaiyushiki stroll garden, and a scroll garden. The entry garden is a dry landscape garden. Imagine you are standing on the sea (black moonstone) and the boulders are the rising landscape of Japan. The bamboo flowing in the wind represents the sound of the ocean. The boulders were moved from a former Japanese garden at the downtown Houston Lighting & Power building downtown.Entrance to the garden is through the gatehouse ornagayamon. A gatehouse at one time was used for living quarters or storage, but here it is used for other purposes, - ticket booth utility room and rest rooms.Through the gate straight ahead there is a welcoming lantern, a gift from the city of Chiba, Japan. This five-piece lantern was carved from solid granite. The aperture of the lantern focuses the spirit of the garden. There are three stone lanterns,ishi-doro, in this garden.Curved pathways in the garden are covered with crushed stone similar to moonstone. The arbor is a place to sit, meditate and clear the mind of other thoughts. It is also special place to wait until called to tea ceremony in the teahouse. Across the pond, one can see the yukimi lantern given by Houston's sister city - Chiba. Imagine that it is a lighthouse placed on a stone beach, with the pond as an ocean and the rocks in the water symbolizing ships being guided by the lantern. The cascade or waterfall makes one think of melting snow from a mountain stream. The hill is landscaped in cherry-blossom-pink crape myrtles, which bloom in the summer. Crape myrtle trees, which originated in China and Japan, are common in Houston. The stones are of Texas pink granite from Marble Falls near Austin.Leaving the arbor, proceed to the right along the flat stones through the tea garden gate or niwakido. Before entering the teahouse, tea ceremony guests walk along this path which the host will have moistened to appear damp with morning dew. This path is hence called the dewy path or roji.The tsukubai, at the end of the dewy path is used to purify oneself before going into the teahouse. This tsukubai arrangement includes the water basin, three flat rocks surrounding it and a bamboo dipper to dip water from the water basin. A beautiful sound is created when water falls through the small stones into the mizukoto or water harp below.Near the teahouse are two viewing stones. When the teahouse is open and one stands on these viewing stones to look through the teahouse, one can see a living picture of the waterfall with the distant pine trees creating a borrowed landscape or shakkei. This living picture resembles a Japanese woodblock print or ukiyoe. It is important to note, the teahouse was placed first and the garden view was then created around it.This teahouse was donated by the Commemorative Association of the World Expo Fund of Japan with the initiative of former Prime Minister Kaifu who visited Houston in 1990 for the World Economic Summit. It was built in Japan and reassembled here by Japanese craftsmen. The teahouse is made from hinoki, or Japanese cypress beams. Hinoki is famous for its smooth, fine grain and is an essential element in Japanese wooden construction. Inside, the crossbeams, which support the ceiling, are made of a special Japanese red cedar tree called Kitayama-sugi from Kyoto, Japan. This wood is carefully cultivated so knots do not develop. Made without nails, the teahouse is an excellent example of Japanese wooden mortise and ten",

The honeycomb rock lining the pathways throughout the garden came from the Lake Travis area.The Japanese Tea House, with a thatched roof over bamboo walls, provides a shady spot to pause and view the gardens.

        "JGarden Description:": "In 1886, Major and Mrs. James H. Dooley acquired a former dairy farm on the James River in what was then Henrico County. From rough fields and pastures, they created a showplace of the type in vogue among the American millionaires of the Gilded Age. Completion of their opulent mansion in 1893 was only the beginning, and throughout the next three decades, the Dooleys continued to develop the grounds of their estate. Maymont today includes many attractions, but for many, the greatest pleasure of Maymont is the expansive 100-acre tract of parkland and gardens, still very much as the Dooleys left it.With high bluffs, massive rock outcroppings, streams and ravines, Maymont\ud066 dramatic fall-line terrain provided an excellent palette for the creation of an eclectic style landscape of the type in fashion for country estates such as Maymont at the turn of the century. Wealthy, well-traveled Victorians, like the Dooleys, expressed their enthusiasm for historical design, for exotic cultures and for nature through the architecture, furnishings and the elaborate landscapes of their estates. At Maymont, rolling lawns in the English park style form a naturalistic backdrop connecting the major components of the landscape.For lovers of horticulture, garden design and architectural history, Maymont is appreciated as an unusually complete and significant example of an American country place of the Gilded Age, a distinctive estate on the grand scale for which luxurious landscaping was an essential part.Maymont\ud066 Japanese Garden is a blend of several different styles of Japanese gardens and two distinct periods of design. In 1911, the Dooleys purchased a wedge-shaped section of the Kanawha Canal that bordered Maymont. To create their garden, they hired Muto, a master Japanese gardener who had designed gardens for other estates along the East Coast. \r\nThe original garden encompassed a much smaller area than the garden today. Over the years after the death of Mrs. Dooley, the garden gradually lost much of its original splendor and detail. In 1978, the garden was renovated by Barry Starke of Earth Design. From Muto\ud066 original design, stonework around the base of the waterfall, several trees and the winding watercourse that leads to the large pond remain. Through federal grants and the ongoing support of Ikebana of Richmond, the garden has evolved over the years to include traditional elements of a Japanese stroll garden, one which offers the visitor changing impressions of nature as the various areas come into view. Carefully pruned trees and shrubs, raked sand pools, stone groupings and water features are intended to create the affect of an old, naturally developed landscape. The pond is populated with Koi, Japanese goldfish of the carp family. A grant from the William B. Thalhimer Foundation and Family supported the completion of the renovation.The site includes trained and pruned trees and shrubs, raked sand pools, stone groupings and multiple water areas -- all designed to create the impression of an old, naturally developed landscape. Design elements include stone lanterns, paths and bridges. Green, brown and gray colors are emphasized to represent the ruggedness of natural scenery. Flowers are used discreetly. Water iris bloom along the water\ud066 edge in spring, followed by the floating blooms of the water lily in summer.One of the most recent additions to the Garden is the northern entrance gate, a traditional archway. Other new refinements include additional plantings by the pond, three new lanterns and a new pathway along the pond. These and other renovations have been made possible through the ongoing support of Ikebana of Richmond, federal grants and the William B. Thalhimer and Family Foundation.A Japanese Garden Guide is available at Maymont which provides interpretive information, blending horticulture, history and Japanese symbolism to enrich your appreciation of<",

Norfolk's unique climate allows co-existence of botanical species usually found widely-separated geographically.  The Garden dates back to 1938, when 200 workers from the Works Progress Administration cleared the dense, native vegetation and planted 4,000 azaleas. Today, the Garden features one of the largest and most diverse collections of azaleas, camellias, roses and rhododendrons on the east coast.The Japanese garden was created in 1962 to honor Norfolk's sister city, Moji, Japan and was rededicated in 1962 to Kitakyushu, formerly Moji. The Japanese Garden was redesigned and refurbished in the summer of 1995. Visitors will enjoy a traditional pond and bridge and foliage native to Japan. Plants to look for in the garden include: Japanese Black Pine, Japanese Snowbell, Hankow Willow, Flowering Cherry, Japanese Red Maple and Japanese Live Oak.",

In addition to the Japanese-inspired guest house and garden, there is a beautiful woodland walk, moss garden and bird sanctuary.  A lovely French country house built in 1931 now serves as a visitor center and overlooks Port Madison Bay.The entire garden covers 150 acres, 84 acres of which are covered with impressive second growth forest.  Once the home of the Bloedel family, the Reserve is now managed by the Arbor Fund.The Japanese garden features an interesting guest house designed by Paul Hayden Kirk in 1961.  This building combines elements of a traditional Japanese tea house with those of a Pacific Northwest Indian loghouse.  The rocks and plants around the structure are the work of Kubota Fujitaro.Adjacent to the guest house lies a very successful raked sand and rock garden built in 1986 by Dr. Kawana Koichi, a professor of landscape architecture at the University of California.  Dr. Kawana edged this dry garden with an irregular checkerboard of alternating greenery and square flat stones which borrows from Shigemori Mirei\u2019s famous 1939 design at Tofukuji Temple in Kyoto.Events include talks and concerts --- check the website for details and a current schedule.BibliographyBloedel, Prentice. \"The Bloedel Reserve: Its Purpose and Its Future.\"University of Washington Arboretum Bulletin. 41:1, Spring 1980, pp 2-8.Brown, Richard. \"The Japanese Garden: An Evolution in Time.\"The Bloedel Reserve. 2:2, Summer/Fall 1990, pp 1,4.Frey, Susan Rademacher. \"A Series fo Gardens.\"Landscape Architecture.

        "JGarden Description:": "Hidden in South Seattle, this 20 acre landscape blends Japanese garden concepts with native Northwest plants. Kubota was a horticultural pioneer who began combining Japanese design techniques with North American materials in his display garden in 1927. The resulting site is in a spectacular setting of hills and valleys, interlaced with streams, waterfalls, ponds, bridges, and rock outcroppings with a rich array of plant material.Kubota arrived in the U.S. from Shikoku in 1907.  The Kubota Gardening Company was established in 1923 and went on to become a successful enterprise, with a garden on the Seattle University campus and the Japanese garden at theBloedel Reserveas only two of the most famous examples.The garden started as a much smaller (5 acre) swampy site in the Rainier Beach neighborhood.  It grew with the business to its current size.  It was the family home, the business office, the nursery and a showcase for the company's techniques.  A stream that naturally flowed through the site was enclosed in a pool and planted in the 1930's.  The garden and home was abandoned in the 1940's when the Kubota family was forced to relocate to Camp Minidoka in Idaho, one of several Japanese internment camps during World War II.  After the war, Kubota worked with his two sons, Tak and Tom to rebuild the business and expand the nursery.  In the 1960's 400 tons of stone were added to the site, increasing the opportunities for new landscape features.Kubota Fujitaro passed way in 1973 at age 94, shortly after he had been awarded with the Fifth Class Order of the Sacred Treasure by the government of Japan for his contributions to Japanese gardening in the U.S.  Later in the 1970's, the site Kubota had built became a target for condominium developers.  Local community groups rallied to have the core 4.5 acre garden declared an historic landmark and succeeded in 1981, when the City of Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board protected it.  The property was acquired by the City of Seattle in 1987 from the Kubota family.  More recently, the City's Open Space Program also purchased the seventeen acres surrounding the garden to remain as a natural area.  The garden is now maintained by the City of Seattle's Department of Parks and Recreation.The garden received a new entrance gate, designed by Gerard Tsutakawa, and wall in 2004.  An entrance garden was designed byKobayashi Koichiand constructed by attendees of the 4th International Symposium on Japanese Gardens in August 2004.The Kubota Garden Foundation was established as a membership-based 'friends' organization in 1989.  The Foundation offers additional support to the garden in the form of additional funding, volunteer work, publications and public tours.  To schedule a guided tour, call the Foundation at 206.725.5060.  Volunteers gather to work on the garden every third Saturday from April to October, 8am - noon.  Call the Kubota Garden Senior Gardener at 206.684.4584 to volunteer at other times.The Parks and Recreation Department permits weddings and other events to be held at the garden.  Contact 206.233.7068 for scheduling and fees.  Commercial photography and filming also require a permit.

Japanese lanterns and an innovative rustic fence contribute to the flavor of this garden which mingles influences from East and West, and combines plant material from the Pacific Northwest with native material from Japan.Bus Routes:Bus routes 271 and 921 have a stop at SE 1st and 116th NE.

This is a one acre lot surrounded by a 12ft english laurel (Prunus laurocerasus) hedge on the south side and an 6'6\" ft wood fence on the west.  Five lombardi poplar stick up through the south hedge.Arthur Erickson was born in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1924. He is considered one of Canada's greatest architects. After studying at the University of British Columbia and receiving his Bachelor of Architecture in 1950 and traveling extensively in Europe and the Far East he returned to establish a practice in Vancouver in 1953.  In 1953 he established Erickson/ Massey Associates with Geoffrey Massey after the two of them won a design competition.Erickson is known for his ability to adapt and extend architectural design principles of Le Corbusier, but his structures have a very North American sense to them and he was a great admirer of Frank Lloyd Wright.  Conrete is his trademark medium. He has designed private homes such as the Puget Sound House and the Newport Beach House and is known for his campus designs for Simon Fraser University (British Columbia) and the University of Lethbridge (Alberta), the stunning Museum of Anthropology at UBC, the Canadian Embassy in Washington D.C., Robson Square (Vancouver), Roy Thomson Hall (Toronto), City Hall in Fresno (California), and the San Diego Convention Center.  His commerical skyscrapers include 1075 West Georgia (Vancover), British Columbia Centre (Vancover), Etisalat Tower II (Dubai, Saudi Arabia), and One and Two California Plaza (Los Angeles).He was awarded an honorary doctorate from McGill University in Montreal in 1975 and is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada Gold Medal and the Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects.",

With the exception of the Japanese garden, designed by Takeo Shiota (1881-1946), the site's buildings and grounds were designed by Bruce Price as a Georgian style estate.The site lies on the outer coastal plain, home to the New Jersey Pine Barrens and the sandy soil of this region was not conducive to growing much of anything.  To amend the soil, 5,000 carloads of loam were brought to Georgian Court from neighboring Monmouth County.The arboretum was established in 1989 to maintain and expand the existing gardens, which include an Italian garden, a more formal garden, and a sunken garden in addition to the Japanese one.   The arboretum was named after Sister Mary Grace Burns, chair of the biology department from 1927 to 1968.The Japanese garden was a birthday gift to Edith Gould from her husband, George.  A visitor enters near amachaiand can follow a path that goes past a teahouse, leads over a wooden footbridge and continues to the back of the garden.  The garden includes specimens of Japanese Yew, cherry, weeping cherry,hinoki(cypress), maples, azalea, iris, goldenchain tree, and lily-of-the-valley.  The garden is at its best from mid-April to early June and then from mid-October to mid-November.",

The park is located at Falls Park is located where Cottonwood Creek crosses under Highways 3A and 6.  The City of Nelson is located on the southeast corner of B.C., about 60 miles north of the border with Washington and Idaho.\r\n\r\nShuzenji is located near a Cottonwood Falls and a large tunnel, both combining to generate an enormous amount of noise.  The area had originally been cleared for a highway by tossing piles of stone.  These two conditions have shaped the form and construction of the garden.  The garden has developed through the sister-city relationship between Shuzenji/Izushi and the City of Nelson.  The towns exchange 25 home-stays per year from Nelson, but Nelson has hosted 2,500+ children and students in the past 17 years.  The garden is designed to raise the awareness of local children for what they might gain by spending some time in Japan.  The original inspiration was Jim Sawada.  To get the garden built, Sawada assembled a committee that included an ex-Fire Chief, retired City Treasurer, Building Inspector, Director of Public Works, City Alderman, head of parks and Recreation.  Bridge crossing the Cottonwood is modeled after the larger bridge crossing the Katsura River in Shuzenji.  Cherry trees have been planted on the slope to evoke the Japanese hillside.  A great deal of work was performed by volunteers and in-kind services.The site is shared by Earth Matters, an environmental group, and the local Gun Club.  The garden has become a catalyst for the revitalization of these other uses of the site.  The Cottonwood Falls now has a weekend market which brings in 250-400 people each weekend.",

The Golden Door has consistently garnered praise for its magnificent landscaping, artfully appointed rooms, excellent gourmet cuisine, and more.Located in the Southern California countryside, 40 miles north of San Diego, the Golden Door occupies 377 acres of orchard, avocado, groves, woodlands, and gardens. A jewel-encrusted entrance gate flanked by camellias, fuchsia, and other blossoms leads you through courtyards of ornamental gardens. There are meditative sand gardens and fountains. Rare antique stone lanterns-- part of a million dollar art and antique collection are displayed throughout the grounds.The facilities include three guest lounges, a dining room, kitchen, indoor/outdoor exercise studios and the Dragon Tree Gym with the latest in Cybex equipment and a Beauty Court.

        "JGarden Description:": "This garden is located in downtown Paris on the grounds of UNESCO Headquarters.  It was originally donated to UNESCO by the Japanese government.  The 1700 sq meter site occupies a large central courtyard.  It is filled with 80 tons of stone (selected by Noguchi and brought from Japan), a stream, pond, concrete bridge, grass and stone covered mounds, magnolias, flowering cherries and plums, lotuses and bamboo.If you enter the site looking for a 'Japanese' garden, you'll immediately move toward the sunken section in the center of the courtyard space.  But this is really only the beginning.  The more traditional (and more vegetated) section below ground is contrasted in the Noguchi design with a much more stark, concrete and stone design at the ground level.  The contrast between a stark, 20th century version of modernism is woven with the more traditional garden through the use of a stream and path armature that anchors the spaces and binds them both together.  Water flows from a large stone slab labeled the 'Peace Fountain'.  This slab stands as a sort of monolith in a rectangular pool of water cascading over a mirror-image inscription of the Japanese character, 'wa' meaning 'peace and harmony'.  The water from here flows down this worked stone to a concrete channel that steps down a slope into the sunken garden, breaking from its straight channel into a series of curvilinear pools at the bottom.Even the sunken garden is really a hybrid space, uniting a island and pond formation with akaresansuidry garden arrangement.  The plantings are distributed amongst these stone skeleton.  While the garden was undoubtedly intended as a contemplative space, it is designed to be walked as well as seen.  The pathway is said to represent Buddhism metaphors for passage from the material life into the Pure Land.  The raised paved area is the Pure Land from which one arrives and departs via the stepping stones.Directly behind the Peace Fountain is the Nagasaki Angel, jutting from the wall.  This status was originally part of the fa\u00e7ade of the Urakami Church in Nagasaki.  It was the only part that remained after the destruction of the church by the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.  It was donated to UNESCO by the City of Nagasaki in 1978 and incorporated into the Noguchi space after that.At the edge of the Noguchi design, further behind the Peace Fountain, is a cylindrical Meditation Space designed by Tadao Ando, the contemporary Japanese architect.  This space is also replete with atomic bomb symbols.  The structure rests on a slanted surface paved with granit exposed to the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945.  It was later cleaned for use by Ando, but is now incorporated into the structure such that a constant flow of water now washes over the once irradiated stone.At the opposite end of the garden from the Ando piece and the Peace Fountain is a sculpture is a painted mosaic called 'Water Rhythm' by Jean Bazaine, a French artist.  It is intended to appear as a 'living surface' through its use of enamelled ceramic and stones.On the other side of Building 3, on the far north end of the courtyard is a new memorial to Yitzak Rabin, the prime minister of Israel assassinated on November 4, 1995.  An olive tree is planted in a large sculptural arrangement.The courtyard is quite large.  The people on site say that you can get the best view of the sculptural nature of the Noguchi design from a large wood bench located near the Peace Fountain.  The bench itself is symbolic.  It's made of a single split red cedar from Mac Millan Bloedel forests in British Columbia and was donated to UNESCO by the Canadian government.The Noguchi garden was restored by master gardener, Toemon Sano (specified in Noguchi's will) who had also executed the original Noguchi design.  The soil and trees had deteriorated over the previous forty years.  T",

        "JGarden Description:": "Located in Margaret T. Hance Park in central Phoenix, the garden is easily accessible from all parts of the Valley.  This recently completed sister-city garden lies on 3.5 acres with a 0.8 acre pond in the middle.  It is vegetated with more than 50 varieties of plants that can withstand the rigors of a desert environment.  1,500 tons of rock were handpicked from quarries near Jerome, Superior, Congress and Florence to line the stream beds, walking paths, lakeshore and main lake waterfall.Himeji became a Phoenix sister city in November 1976 and is one of nine sister cities. Phoenix and Himeji participate in business, governmental, cultural and educational exchanges that promote international goodwill and understanding. The Garden is very much a shared cultural vision of the cities of Phoenix and Himeji.  Landscape architects from Himeji, Japan made 60 trips to Phoenix and City of Phoenix delegations made 5 trips to Himeji since 1987. Overall, more than 50 architects from Himeji, the sister-city, contributed to the project.  The Garden combined the knowledge and skills of both teams to create an authentic Japanese stroll garden that is adapted to the demands of a desert environment.  The total construction cost was $3.8 million by bond funds and an additional $1.0 million from private donations. The name Ro Ho En is a combination of three Japanese words. 'Ro' means Heron, a bird symbol of Himeji City. Shira Sagi Jou, or the White Heron, is a 300-year-old medieval castle in Himeji. 'Ho' is the Japanese word for the Phoenix bird. 'En' means garden.The Garden was made possible partially through funding provided through a Cultural Bond Election, overwhelmingly approved by Phoenix voters in 1988. The bond funds, which became available in 1998, covered only a part of the cost of building the Garden. A volunteer committee of Valley residents worked to raise the additional funding through private individual, corporate and group donations. The committee's goal was to raise one million dollars. The Garden is a city of Phoenix park and all donations are tax-deductible, but you should consult your own tax advisor. In addition to monetary gifts, there may be appropriate in-kind donations including materials and services.

        "JGarden Description:": "This was a smaller 'detached palace' found on the southeast corner of the Nara Imperial Palace compound.  From historical literature, we can infer that there were probably several gardens in Nara during the period when the capital was located there, but only about ten of them are known by name and To-in is one of them.  As a site that has been both extensively excavated and and one that has a relatively wide range of historical documents, this is a truly significant garden.From the extensive excavations of this site, it is thought that there was an original garden built here in the early 8th century, but that this was radically changed in the mid-8th century.  The old garden was covered over and the new one built on top.The To-in that was excavated was probably similar to other gardens of its time.  It had the basic sinuous shape of a kyuseki or gyoseki garden. But unlikeKyusekisite, To-in's pond was only lined with stones around the edge. A large garden pavilion was located on the eastern edge of the pond with an island located within, possibly in reference to the Taoist Island of the Immortals (Kuitert 1991). The basic layout and geomancy of the garden has been compared to that of Anap-ji in Korea, though this latter site is at least ten times larger (Kuitert, 1991 ; Song, 1982). There are also two bridges connecting the pond edge with the island.The design elements are all present on this early site, though not yet refined into their later form, for what would, in the Heian period, become a ubiquitous design pattern. Ponds with pavilions above the water, islands and bridges to them would later be known as the Pure Land style. It is a design thematic that can still be found in Japan today.ReferencesKuitert, Wybe. \"Two Early Gardens\".The Aesthetic Garden: A Symposium on Gardens. edited by L. Tjon Sie Fat and Eric de Jong.

        "JGarden Description:": "Shoyoan was built in 1987 through the generosity of Mansfield Freeman, a graduate of Wesleyan University in 1916, whose endowment established the Mansfield Freeman Center for East Asian Studies. The garden was constructed in 1995, with further gifts from the Freeman family and the encouragement of Mr. Freeman's son, Houghton Freeman. Planned from the start as an educational resource, the ensemble provides a tangible means of experiencing Japanese aesthetics and exploring the cultural values that these spaces embody. The room and garden are actively used for a wide variety of purposes, ranging from meetings of small classes and Japanese tea ceremonies to quiet contemplation and meditation.Shoyoan Teien is an intimately scaled courtyard garden, designed to be viewed from a stationary location.  This garden is akaresansui(dry landscape) garden centering on  a series of abstract forms that allude to features from the local landscape including the Connecticut River and rolling hills of the region.  Stone in the garden was salvaged from nearby brownstone quaries.Shoyoan received a Green Dove Awared from Common Boundary, a Bethesda, Maryland-based organization dedicated to \"exploring psychology, spirituality, and creativity.\" In making the award, Common Boundary said the garden \"stood out for its sheer beauty\" and the way it \"addresses the interface of ecology, psychology, and spirituality by exploring the relationship between humans and our natural environment.\"From the web site:\"The Freeman garden was designed and built in summer 1995 bySteven A. Morrell, a landscape architect specializing in Japanese-style gardens. His earlier public projects have included meditation gardens for Zen Mountain Monastery in Mount Tremper, New York, and Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, New York, as well as a tea garden exhibition for the New York Japan Society. Since 1981, he has been Curator of the John P. Humes Japanese Stroll Garden in Mill Neck, New York.\"Shoyoan Teien falls within the tradition of the viewing garden, one intended primarily for contemplative viewing from within an adjoining roomor from a veranda or bench just outside. Unlike the more expansive strolling garden, which presupposes a moving viewer and sequential experience of shifting views, an intimately scaled courtyard garden like Shoyoan Teienis designed to disclose its full panorama to a stationary visitor seated at its edge. The tradition of the viewing garden has a long history in Japan, attaining its classic formulation in the fifteenth- and sixteenth-century gardens of such Zen monasteries as Ryoanji and Daitokuji in Kyoto.Shoyoan Teien embodies the aesthetic of the \"dry-landscape\" (karesansui),which centers on the use of suggestively laid courses of gravel to evoke a sense of water, flowing through raked patterns of ripples and waves. As is often the case in Japanese gardens, the landscape is not a completely idealized one, but contains a number of forms that alude to prominent featuresof the local environment. Here, the turning course of the raked gravelis meant to evoke the bend in the Connecticut River as it flows through Middletown, while the undulating clusters of Mugo pine on the farther banksuggest the gently rolling hills of the region. Similarly, the stone used in the garden is brownstone, salvaged from the old brownstone quarries across the river in Portland.In 1996, the Freeman garden received the Green Dove Award from Common Boundary, a Bethesda, Maryland-based organization dedicated to \"exploring psychology, sprituality, and creativity.\" In making the award, Common Boundary said the garden \"stood out for its sheer beauty\" and the way it \"addresses the interface of ecology, psychology, and spirituality by exploring therelationship between hymans and our natural environment.\"",

        "JGarden Description:": "The Japanese garden is a relic from the 1913 World Fair in Wroclaw. It was created and laid out by a Japanese culture lover, Count Fritz von Hochberg, helped by a Japanese gardener, Mankichi Arai. In the following years, the garden was not well taken care of and some of the elements that were lent for the World Fair were removed and the garden lost part of its Japanese character.In 1994, the city of Wroclaw decided to renovate it with the support of the Japanese embassy in Warsaw.  Japanese professionals from the city of Nagoya worked at its renovation.Many new elements were added with respect to the original form. The result is exceptional and it is now a real masterpiece. Each element of the garden has its own meaning, that will not be understood by most novice visitors.Highlight of the garden are the two waterfalls. The male one with its rapid flow and the female one, which flows on three intermediate levels. The water from the two waterfalls flows towards a pond.Located close to Hala Ludowa (Centenary Hall) on\r\nMickiewicza Stvirtual walk, photos and others:http://www.wroclaw.pl/ogrod/wirt_1.htmdescription (polish version only):http://www.wroclaw.pl/m/28photos:http://psyborg.rpg.pl/gallery.php?s=ogrodjaponskihttp://www.adamski.pl/foto/galeria/wroclaw/ogrod-japonskifree e-book, PDF document, (5MB):http://www.adamski.pl/cgi-bin/load.cgi?ebook/Ogrod_Japonski.pdf",

        "JGarden Description:": "B\u00e9atrice de Rothschild was born on 14 September 1864. The daughter of Leonora Rothschild and sister of Bettina Rothschild, she shared with them a somewhat unworldly appearance. According to theRothschild Archive, \"she was fond of the colour pink, which together with her prematurely white hair, suggested a soft, undefined character. The opposite was actually true. B\u00e9atrice could be authoritarian, capricious even, and was a woman of vision.\"Being interested in the casino at Monte Carlo, B\u00e9atrice had this estate built in the South of France.  The villa proper is an art museum showcasing both her own choices and the pieces she inherited from her father.  The exterior is filled with thematic gardens showcasing European and Asian cultural landscapes.  The dominant color is pink and she held receptions here in which she sought to recreate the splendor of Marie-Antoinette's court at Versailles.After her death on 7 April 1934, B\u00e9atrice's properties in Paris and Reux but the Cap Ferrat estate was given to the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux Arts (Fine Arts Academy) and became Mus\u00e9e Ephrussi de Rothschild (B\u00e9atrice had married a Russian banker, Maurice Ephrussi in 1883 and though the marriage ended, she kept his name alongside her own.)The estate was built upon the narrowest point of the isthmus of Cap Ferrat and looks over the bay of Villefranche to the west and over the Mediterranean to Italy on the east. The villa proper was constructed under the personal supervision of Beatrice herself and houses an eclectic collection of fine art, furniture, and porcelain.  It is still open to the public and was bequeathed with the condition that it be \"kept the essence of a private salon\". The gardens include classic French, Spanish, Florentine, rock, Japanese, exotic plant, rose gardens and Provencal gardens.  The Japanese garden offers a mixture of ceramic temples and pagodas, bamboo thickets and ornamental ponds surrounded by giant acanthus plants.  It's definitely a Japanese garden adapted to the mediterranean climate.Since 1991, the site has been managed by the Culture Espaces Group, which specializes in cultual resource management at heritage buildings and sites.  It is located between Nice and Monaco via the Basse Corniche (N98) road.",

There are 9 demonstration gardens to show how great looking landscapes can be created in even the most stubborn landscapes. Assortments of wildflowers, a Japanese garden, and perennials round out the beautiful gardens of the facility.The Minnesota Landscape Arboretum was founded to find plants that would tolerate the frigid -35\u00b0F winter weather of Minnesota. Landscape materials and winter hardy fruit development were required by the Minnesota Legislature act that established the arboretum. The goals of the arboretum are: a.) to develop winter hardy plant material; b.) to provide extension and University education; c.) to develop a program for children to study plants; and d.) to show and inspire the public about the value of landscape plants.The arboretum is part of the University of Minnesota and administered through the Horticulture Department. The budget is over $4 million a year with 1/3 from the University; 1/3 from gate fees and revenues produced at the arboretum; and 1/3 as gifts and donations. There are 15 permanent staff members, 100 summer employees and 600 volunteers that give tours, do weeding and clerical assistance.Fruit research began around the turn of this century at a farm near the edge of the present arboretum.  Today, there are winter hardy fruits of almost every kind except peaches growing here.  Landscaping plants research began soon after World War II. At the present time there are 935 acres of land at the arboretum and horticulture research center where the fruits are being grown. The fruit shade tree plantings began in 1958.The Japanese garden is one of three in the twin cities region. There is also a home demonstration garden where nine different landscapes are illustrated. These include: a rock garden, a deck garden, a cut flower garden, a container garden, a garden for small spaces, an herb garden, a garden for outdoor living, a fruit and vegetable garden, a naturalistic garden, and an AllAmerican trial garden. The peony garden contains 150 new varieties. The rose garden has over 200 varieties of Tea Roses. Since roses die at 20\u00b0F, the \"Minnesota tip method\" was developed to keep the plants alive. Other areas of the arboretum include an Azalea garden, sugar maples, prairie wildflower display, shade tree display, a ginkgo collection, a maple grove, lindens, a weeping tree collection, crabapples, a small tree collection, a spruce collection, a  pine collection containing over 100 varieties, several ash trees are growing, and there is an elm collection.Gift ShopOffers books in horticulture and related subjects, unique cards and graphics, and special Arboretum and Minnesota gift items to make your visit memorable.Tea RoomDaily serves hearty cafeteria-style lunches with homemade soups, gourmet salads and great freshly baked desserts. Picnic lunches and catered buffets are available for groups.Wheel AccessibilityWheelchairs are available without charge. See Lobby Desk receptionist. Most of grounds are accessible by wheelchair, or by motorized vehicle on paved drive.How to Get to the ArboretumThe Minnesota Landscape Arboretum is located about 4 miles west of Chanhassen on State Hwy. 5, just one quarter-mile west of the intersection of State Hwy. 5 and State Hwy. 41.From MinneapolisTake 35W to I-494 west to State Hwy. 5 (exit 11C). \r\nOR, take 35W to the Crosstown (62), go west and follow the signs to Hwy. 212, but do not exit the highway, and continue west on State Hwy. 5. \r\nFollow State Hwy. 5 for about 9.25 miles, past Chanhassen, past the intersection of State Hwy. 5 and State Hwy. 41.

        "JGarden Description:": "Bonnie Teasdel's Japanese garden began with an essay rather than a design.  She had been left an inheritance by her mother who had also built Japanese gardens in New Orleans and Rancho Santa Fe.  After visiting the gardens of Kyoto, she decided to use the inheritanc eto build her own garden.  The garden master, Saito Katsuo, then 92, was visiting California at the time.  He asked her to write down her reasons for wanting him to do the design as well as how the garden would subsequently be used.  In her essay, Teasdel pledged to share the private garden with others and credits this promise with Saito's agreement to do the work.Teasdel's garden has three sections: a stroll garden, a meditation garden and a tea garden (roji).  Teasdel uses the tea house to practice ikebana and to hold tea ceremonies for guests.  The garden also has several unconventional elements, however.  The swimming pool is what separates it from Saito's 400 other gardens.  The pool won a gold medal from the National Swimming Pool in 1989.  It's moss-covered rock edges, diving rock and turtle island with akuromatsupine in the center make it a unique site.  The garden also includes a spa and koi pond. Another innovation was the integration of computer controls for the lighting, cleaning and waterfalls that feed the  pool and attached koi pond.Teasdel did more than write checks for the project.  She personally selected all of the 210 tons of local stone from a quarry in the Sutter Buttes (known as the world's smallest mountain range).  She even flew out to Los Angeles to rent a truck and drive back 60 bags of Mexican black stones, the delayed arrival of which had threatened to derail the project.  Her well-thumbed copy of Saito's bookMagic of Trees and Stoneshas been a guide throughout the process.After the stone skeleton of the garden was in place, the second phase began.  This consisted of the construction of a teahouse orchateiand required 75 craftspeople to complete. The third phase was the addition of akaresansuimeditation garden just outside the fence that surrounds the main garden.  This area also includes a grouping of stones with a 6ft black pine (kuromatsu) that welcomes the visitor into the garden.Teasdel describes the garden as aspiring toshibui.  According to her, Saito wanted \"people to feel the unity of the rocks and water, and all the trees and plants. Unity is the principle of why I build these gardens all over the world. Friendship, and the feeling that we are one people, is what I express in these gardens.",

The Bell was a gift from a Japanese individual  in 1954 and was cast from coins collected by children from 60 different countries.  It is housed in a structure ressembling a Shinto shrine, made of cypress.  A World Peace Bell Association has grown up around this tradition and now 13 peace bells exist around the world.  There is also one in theCowra Japanese Gardenin New South Wales, Australia.The Committee for the Peace Bell Garden at the United Nations commissionedShinichiro Abe and ZEN Associatesto design and build a new garden around the Bell. The new design symbolically represents the seven continents of the globe, as depicted on the United Nations Flag.  The Peace Bell Tower is located in the center, at the conceptual North Pole.  Surrounding this is a courtyard of blue paving stone with longitude and latitude lines carved.  The garden was completed in August 2000 and has become a popular tourist attraction with over 3,000 visitors a day.The Visitors' Entrance is located on First Avenue at 46th Street. As the United Nations does not offer parking facilities, it is suggested that public transportation be used.Subway: number 4,5,6 or 7 trains to Grand Central Station; walk on 42nd Street to First Avenue.Buses: M15, M27, M42, or M104.",

The Botanical Gardens are attempting to raise the $4 million necessary to construct it.The central feature of the garden will be a one-acre pool. The site is on the floor of a valley which has very steep slopes. Streams, boulders and waterfalls will be installed on these steep slopes and re-circulate water from the main pool. Architectural features will include a Japanese cultural center, a traditional tea house, arbors, bridges and other garden features. These structures will be built by Japanese craftsmen using centuries old traditions and designs. Further enhancing the the garden is the recent gift of 24 carved stone lanterns. These beautiful works of art will be located throughout the garden. A gift of Mr. Yoichiro Suzuki and Mr. Tsutomu Asada of Shizuoka, these lanterns range in size from 2.5 feet to 11 feet tall and represent many different styles of lanterns.  The ZEN Associates design was funded as a gift to the people of Omaha by Mr. Yuichi Kawai, a key figure in the Sister City relationship between Omaha and Shizuoka for many years.",

Basho once referred to Kyorai by saying, \"In Kyoto, there is Kyorai, who is in charge of haikai in Western Japan.\"  Kyorai was the most important poet to continue Basho's authentic style after the master died.The cottage was listed in the Shui Miyako Meisho Zue, an Edo period travel book that listed famous places to see in Kyoto.  The name of the place is derived from a story of how Kyorai achieved enlightenment.  As the story goes, Kyorai had forty persimmon (kaki) trees planted around the hut.  One autumn, when they were heavy with fruit, he had arranged to sell the persimmons.  But during the night before they were to be picked, a great storm arose.  The following morning, not a single persimmon remained on the trees.  As a result Kyorai was enlightened and from that point forward called the hut and garden,Rakushisaor 'the cottage of the fallen persimmons'.  The poem he wrote for the occasion is inscribed on a stone in the garden:kakinushi yakozue wa chikakiArashiyamaMaster of PersimmonsTreetops are close toArashiyamaThere's a bit of word play here.  Arashiyama is a mountain near Kyoto but it means literally 'Storm Mountain'.Basho visited here three times, in 1689, 1691 and 1694.  On the second occasion, from April 18 to May 5, the diary he kept became known as theSaga Nikkiand was published in 1753 (Horeki 3).  His last visit here was about four months before his death.  In the western corner of the garden, a poem is inscribed in a stone:samidare yashikishi hegitarukabe no atosummer rainstrace of a poem cardtorn off the wallThe garden is littered with poem stones by various masters that have lived and visited here including Takahama Kyoshi, Shaku Hyosai, Kudo Shiranshi,  and Hirasawa Ko.  Shaku Hyosai was both a journalist for the Asahi Shinbun (the equivalent of the New York Times in Japan) and an accomplished practitioner ofhaiga(haiku + painting).  He made a significant contribution to the conservation of the Rakushisa site, which is now managed by the Rakushisa Conservation Association.Kyorai's gravestone is in Kogenji graveyard, about 100 meters north of Rakushisa.  It is a small stone marked with simply 'Kyorai'.",

        "JGarden Description:": "This garden and residence were first built in 1658 by Mitsuhisa Shimazu, the 19th patriarch of the Shimazu family, a powerful clan in Kyushu.  The current site is estimated to be only a third of the size of the original, but it impresses, nonetheless.  Weighing in at 48 hectares, it includes artificial mountains, rivers and borrowed landscapes that highlight the still active Sakurajima volcano.KyokusuiExpansions were made to the estate in 1702 by Yoshitaka, the 21st head of the family.  He also built a second garden nearby calledKyokusui, where Heian periodkyokusui-no-enparties were re-enacted.  At these events, guests would sit on opposite sides of a winding stream - thekyokusuiorgyokusui- and write poetry while enjoying sake and food.  Each guest would alternate writing a line of a poem and then floating it down the stream to the next guest who would add another line.  The garden was buried by a landslide a few years after its construction and was never rebuilt.  Its existence was confirmed in 1959 and excavation and restoration work followed in the 1960's.  Today, a Kyokusui Festival is held at Senganen, celebrating this very old tradition.  [BTW,kyokusuifestivals are also held at Okayama'sKorakuenand atMotsuji Temple. rc]  Yoshitaka is also remembered in Japan for his introduction from China ofgiantmosobamboo, the bamboo used in bamboo shoots.LanternsIn addition to the kyokusui restoration, there are several other notable elements to this site.  The lower garden has two important historictoro(stone lanterns).  The first is known as the 'Lion Lantern', designed by the then head gardener, Oda Kisanji, in 1884.  The lantern is noted for its use of a massive rock from the nearby seashore as its capstone.  The second lantern, the 'Crane Lantern', is somewhat older and perhaps more interesting.  Its name derives from the crane-shaped, brown capstone.  But it is interesting for the installation of a gas lamp in the lantern by Nariakira Shimazu (27th lord).  It is said to be the first use of piped gas in Japan.PlantsIn addition to a oft ignored semi-tropical woodland above the garden, the grounds include several notable plants.  An large evergreen cherry known asbakuchi-no-ki('gambling tree' - this tree loses all of its bark each spring and reminding us of the losses one can suffer from gambling) is planted in the Kyokusui restoration.  A tall Amami pine (yakutane-goyooramami-goyo;Pinus armandiivar. amamiana) dominates the area near the residence.  It is thought to be 300 years old and is still in good health.  The Amamipine has five stiff needles.  The name 'yakutane' is derived from the islands Yakushima and Tanegashima, where it originates.  There is some disagreement among botanist concerning whether this is a distinct species or a variety of Chinese white pine.  Another interesting species here is thenoshi-ran(Ophiopogon jaburan), a giant relative ofLiriope muscari.The FamilyNarioki, the 26th Shimazu lord, created another oddity in 1814.  Rarely seen in Japan, but much more common in China, he employed 3,800 workers to carve the huge kanji characters 'Senjingan (1000 Foot Crag) on a cliffside.  Each character is 11 meters high.  Tadayoshi, the 29th Shimazu, was no less audacious.  He harnessed the Kenkura River, which flows through the garden, to generate electricity for the Shuseijo Factory, one of the ealiers Japanese efforts to develop Western-style industrial enterprises.  The dam is no longer there but the ruins can be seen in the garden.The Shimazu family was one of the most powerful and long-lasting families in Japanese history, holding sway in what is now Kagoshima and Miyaz",

The kanji that form the name, shin ('friendship') and wa ('harmony'), are meant to represent the bond that is physically manifested in the garden. The construction of the garden brought together volunteers and donations from the university, local communities, the Gardena Valley Gardener's Association, local chapters of the California Landscape Contractor's Association and the California Association of Nurserymen.  Ground was broken February 19 and the dedication held November 19.Yamashiro Haruo's design for the 1100 square foot space is a miniature island landscape dominated by mountains and forests and surrounded by the sea.  It combines elements of a tea garden with that of akaresansuidry garden. Volunteers selected 60 tons of Malibu rock from Ventura County and then transported it to the campus site.  Each stone was moved into place by hand.   This is a traditional garden with the stones buried deep into the ground for an appearance of stability and groupings (ishi-gumi) of three, five or seven.  The water is represented by rocks, pebbles and sand arranged in a stream pattern running north to south below the stairway.  The main architectural feature is a teahouse (chashitsu) built from redwood and cedar.  The structure is sited to obscure the concrete staircase behind.  It is used for tea ceremony and other university events.  Accenting the teahouse are black pines, trained to bow away from the teahouse and toward the visitor, as if to gesture one forward.  Atsukubaiwater basin and two stone lanterns (yukimi-doroandkasuga-doro) are sited to lend depth and perspective to the composition.The limited plant pallette inlcudes:Rhapis humilispalmPodocarpus elongataPinus thunbergii(kuromatsu) - black pineOphiopogon japonicus- Mondo grassEugenia compactaLiriope muscariBaby tear mossAzaleaChrysanthemum",

        "JGarden Description:": "This garden has not yet been constructed, and has recently begun a fundraising campaign.  This new garden will be associated with Ernest and Mary Fenollosa, the art historians who received the highest award ever presented to a foreigner by the Emperor of Japan for their contribution to Japanese art history.  It will be located on the site of a former fish hatchery, fed by a freshwater spring.Mobile has a sister-city relationship with Ichihara-shi in Chiba-ken and this is playing a part in the development of the garden.Ernest F. Fenellosa (1853-1908) made contributions to the development of higher education in Japan as well as research on and preservation of cultural properties during his employment as a civil servant with the national government (1878-1890).  Back in North America, Fenellosa and later, his wife, worked to introduce and propagate Japanese art and culture to Americans.  When he left Japan for the first time in 1890, he was given the Order of the Sacred Mirror (his fourth decoration by the Japanese government and the highest honor ever given to a foreigner) by the Emperor and charged with continuing his work in the United States.  He subsequently worked for the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.  In 1895, he married Mary McNeil who had also gone to Boston to work at the MFA.  In 1896, they went to Japan to lecture and study religion, sociology, Noh theatre and Chinese and Japanese poetry.  They remained there until 1900.  Mary was enormously homesick and used this to write her first novel \"Truth Dexter\", a great success for a first novel and a passionate invocation of her homeland in Mobile, Alabama.  When they returned to the U.S., they established a home in Mobile calledKobonata(Little Sunshine).  Professor Fenollosa continued to travel throught the U.S. and Europe, lecturing and doing research on the arts.  He died suddenly on September 21, 1908 while on a trip to London.  Prior to his death, he had completed a first draft of a book calledEpochs of Chinese and Japanese Art.  It had not yet been submitted to a publisher because much editing and fact checks remained to be done.  Mary picked up in the manuscript after his death and typed the scattered notes and then in 1910, returned to Japan to meet with his former colleagues, made the necessary corrections and additions.  The book was published in 1912 and remains one of the best early surveys of pre-20th century East Asian art.Fenellosa's grave is at Homyo-in in Otsu and there is a memorial at the Tokyo University of Art, which he helped found.  There are few such memorials to Fenellosa in the U.S. and the Fenollosa Hall planned at the Japanese Garden of Mobile will be a historical and cultural continuation of his legacy.  Without the Fenellosa's efforts, a great deal of Japan's artistic and cultural patrimony would have been lost as the shogunate crumbled in 1868.  Mary Fenollosa was from Mobile, and the original site of the Fenollosa's retirement estate (Kobonata) overlooks the proposed site for the Japanese Garden.The Japanese Garden Foundation, Inc., a not-for-profit (501)(C)(3) organization, was chartered on July 25, 1995 for the purpose of developing a Japanese public garden in the City of Mobile. The Foundation is governed by a ten member volunteer board, which includes the Mayor, City of Mobile, the Honorary Counsel General of Japan, and professionals in the fields of law, finance, banking, corporate business and representatives of the community of culture and the arts of Japan.Takeo Uesugi, Ph.Ddesigned the garden and Hayahiko Takase designed the Shoin-style architecture on the site.  The garden is expected to cost US$7.2 million.",

Furthermore, the visits by several Japanese prime ministers to the shrine have caused concern regarding the separation of church and state.The garden behind the shrine is surrounded by a pond (Shin-ike or pond of god) with two teahouses.

        "JGarden Description:": "This museum was established and endowed by Albert Kahn (1860-1940) in the early 20th century.  The gardens were constructed beginning in 1895, but modifications continue to this day.  A garden pavilion was opened in 1965 and the gallery building that houses the photographic archive of Kahn's various photographic expeditions was opened in 1992.  The area nearest the museum is the Japanese garden with the 'Blue Forest', Vosge Forest and the Orchard in the area furthest away, behind the greenhouse/restaurant/pavilion.  The Blue Forest has been closed since 1998 due to damage incurred in the hurricane that year.  It is expected to re-open in 2002.The Japanese garden is a bit inconsistent.  It is unclear to me how much of it was designed by Kahn himself, and what was done later.  Albert Kahn had visited Japan twice and had clearly visited many gardens and temples while there.  The section closest to the museum building is quite well conceived, constructed and somewhat well maintained.  But the area moving away from the building along the artificial stream and toward the pond does not work well at all.  It begins with an incongruous stone and cement cone that is likely modeled after the conical sand forms at Ginkakuji, but it doesn't work very well at all here.  The cement edging along the serpentine stream that leads from the cone is quite obtrusive and the design unresolved.  There are, nonetheless, many fine tree specimens including ginkgo biloba, linden, and poplar.  In addition, some pier-like structures that jut into the stream are very beautiful.  These are the vestiges of an old milk factory transported here from Normandy by Kahn.Kahn began building the Orchard, Palmarium and gardens on three parcels of land of four hectares that he acquired in 1895.  He hired the landscape architect Achille Duchene to do the design.  His intent was a world study center where students could gather to study the cultures of the world and further his dream of an international civilization and a search for peace between all peoples.  To this end he established fellowships for graduate students, began a Planetary Archive (Archives de la Plan\u00e9te) of images and movies collected from all over the world.  Kahn, the wealthy banker, lost most of his fortune in the stock market crash of 1929, but most of the various institutions he established survive to this day, though their goal is now primarily one of  conservation.  \r\n\r\nNearest metro stop is Boulogne Pont de St. Cloud (last stop on Line 10).  There is also an associated library and 'Maison de la Nature' at 9, quai du 4 Septembre 92100 Boulogne-Billancourt (0)1.43.03.33.56",

        "Other Description:": "From J.L. VanKlaveren:Of refined beauty, this new garden planted in the heart of the Principality\r\nwas designed, at the request of H.S.H. Prince Rainier III, by the landscape\r\narchitect Yasuo Beppu, Winner of the Flower Exhibition of Osaka\u201990. Mr\r\nBeppu has created here a veritable work of art which honours the strictest\r\nprinciples stemmed from a secular tradition.Originating from China, the concept of a Japanese Garden goes back to the\r\n6th century. It is based on three fundamental elements : the line, the\r\npoint and the surface, illustrated here by a long path circumventing a\r\nlarge lake and a waterfall.The Japanese Garden is a stylized copy of Nature and incorporates all its\r\nelements : mountains, hills, waterfalls, beaches, streams, lakes\u2026The\r\nconcept of compactness comes from the Zen philosophy which advocates\r\nMeditation as a way of seeking beauty and serenity. Structured in an\r\nasymmetrical and near-natural way, this garden has taken more than 17\r\nmonths to create.Since the great Shintoist priest of the Dazaifu Temple, in Fukuoka, on 25th\r\nNovember 1992, blessed the chosen site on the shores of the Mediterranean,\r\nwithin a short distance from the Grimaldi Forum Monaco, every possible care\r\nhas been given to this garden to enable the visitors to enjoy all the\r\nmultiple facets of the Japanese landscape.Each element in this garden has been considered in minute detail to guide\r\nthe visitor towards an inner world.The Wall (He\u00ef):Its line has been broken by bamboo fencing to soften the\r\nvisual rhythm. Heightened by a row of parasol pine-trees, as protection\r\nfrom the sea-winds, it is adorned uphill, with soft pink-flowering cherry\r\ntrees of delicate beauty.The Main Gate (Sh\u00f4-mon)is built in the proximity of the Grimaldi Forum\r\nMonaco. Its imposing proportions are a sign of respect towards the visitor.\r\nThe Stone Lanterns (T\u00f4r\u00f4) of particular beauty have been placed in parts of\r\nthe garden of special interest and all present different characteristics :\r\ncrowned with a sphere which reflects the fire dedicated to the God who will\r\ngrant a wish (Kasuga), or sculptured with lotus flower petals (Yunoki) ;\r\nothers are typified by a very large roof (Yukimi), or have thirteen storeys\r\n(Tas\u00f4-t\u00f4) ; others can be admired at the entrance to the Tea House (Riky\u00f9),\r\nand in the lake (Mizu-hotaru).The Lake (Ik\u00e9):With its slightly-slanting pebble beach, this vast smooth\r\nmirror shimmers in the heart of the garden.\r\nThe Stone Fountain (Fusen-Ishi) flows towards the lake as if to wish the\r\nPrincipality long prosperity.The Covered Terrace (Kyuke\u00efjo):with its copper roof and partly overlooking\r\nthe lake according to a tradition which dates back to the 12th century,\r\nlargely opens out onto the Mediterranean Sea.The Bamboo Fencing (Tak\u00e9gaki) represents simplicity, lightness and\r\nfragility for, according to the Japanese philosophy, although it marks a\r\nboundary, it is nevertheless a welcoming sight.The Islands (Shima):As complementary as two happy animals enjoying a long\r\nlife :the tortoise, round and slow, which is setting out on a long journey\r\n      to the seven oceans is represented by the island with two pine trees.the crane, tall and fast, which makes its nest to sit on its eggs\r\n      and thrive, is represented by the second island with only one pine\r\n      tree.The gate of the Tea House (Cha-mon) opens onto a path (Rojo) intentionally\r\ncreated for walking with little steps, a veritable cleansing path. (Note :\r\na fossil on the stone to the left). It leads to five water stones\r\n(Tsukuba\u00ef) where the visitor is invited to purify both mind and body with a\r\nladle of water, before entering the Tea House.The Tea house (Chatshitsu): Named the \u201cGarden of Grace\u201d (Ga-\u00e9n) in tribute\r\nto the Princess of Mo",

Parking is available, but the zoo is also accessible by tram or train. Tram 55 from William Street Monday-Saturday and Tram 68 from Elizabeth Street run on Sundays. Trains run from historic Flinders Street Station on the Upfield or Gowrie lines Monday through Sunday, stopping at Melbourne Zoo's own Royal Park Station.The Japanese garden is located just past the zoo's main gate to the right.  Amap is availableon the web site.The garden was completed in November 1991 on the old site of the Pygmy Hippopotamus exhibit.  It sets a tone of elegance for the meeting center and Lakeside Bistro.  It was constructed in honor of the Sister-State relationship between Victoria and Aichi Prefecture, where an Australian garden is now open to visitors.Nakane Shiro, the Kyoto landscape architect, designed the site and supervised the construction process.  While stone forms the bones of this garden, the plant selection provides interest during all seasons, though the sequence of cherry blossoms in spring is supposed to be of particular note.Melbourne Zoo is the oldest zoo in Australia and is among the oldest zoos in the world. Originally located on the river flats in Richmond, it was modeled after the London Zoo. In 1862 the Royal Park site was given to the zoo by the City of Melbourne. The grounds were laid out on formal lines to create a garden atmosphere.  This early zoo was not one we would recognize today, however.  Australia was importing large numbers of domestic animals and song birds at the time and before being sent to a station or released into the bush, they required a period of acclimitisation after their long journey from Europe.  The zoo served as an animal acclimatisation park.The real development of a Zoological collection began with the appointment of Albert Le Souef in 1870. He acquired monkeys, American Black Bears, lions, tigers and other species as well as adding picnic grounds and garden beds.  Through the rest of the 19th century and early 20th century, the collection was steadily expanded and diversified.  The Zoo maintained a very strong Australian collection, establishing a special section in 1934 to display platypus, koala and other native animals.In the 1960s the Zoo began a modernisation program under chairman, Alfred Dunbavin Butcher. The Lion Park was the first major exhibit. Innovative exhibits such as the Arboreal Primate enclosure, the Great Flight Aviary and the Butterfly House followed.  In the 1980s a master plan was developed, dividing the Zoo into bioclimatic zones: an African Rainforest; an Asian Rainforest; and the Australian Bush.Today, the Zoo is actively involved with local and regional conservation and research programs, education, and international projects in Vietnam, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines.  While the Royal Park site is still the main zoo, since the mid-1970's, the Zoological Board of Victoria (now known as the Zoological Parks and Gardens Board) has been responsible for an Open Range Zoo of 116 acres at Werribee and a 175 hectare bushland santuary in Healesville.TheJOJG2003 Australian Garden Surveylisted this as the highest quality Japanese garden in Australia.",

        "JGarden Description:": "Roosevelt High School has served the community of Boyle Heights since 1924.  That community has changed a great deal since its founding.When students at the school learned of the injustices suffered by Japanese-American families at the hands of the government and community during the 1940's, they decided to do something about it.  They designed and constructed a Japanese garden on the school grounds as a tribute to the Japanese-American students from the high school removed from their homes and interned during World War II.  The story became even more interesting when it was discovered that a Japanese garden had been planted by Japanese-American students on the same site over 50 years before.As part of the process of creating the garden and a curriculum that emphasizes service learning, the students researched the history of the internment.  They contacted some of the Japanese-American students who had created the original garden, asking for advice, stories and design information.  The new garden was planted on the same site as the original, which had been destroyed by members of the community after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  The project grew to include students, Japanese-American alumna and members of the community, all contributing time and money to the project.The garden was dedicated on May 6, 1996 as part of a ceremony granting honorary high school diplomas to the Japanese-American students interned before they could graduate.  While this East L.A. community is mostly Latino today, the garden is a tribute to both the Japanese-American community of Los Angeles and the hope of overcoming racial tensions with which the  community struggles today.",

Located near Hot Springs National Park, the Garden's gently-sloping Ouachita Mountain terrain covers 210 acres of a forested peninsula jutting into Lake Hamilton. The gardens showcase floral landscapes, free-flowing streams and waterfalls, as well as breathtaking architectural structures in a natural woodland setting. This woodland habitat is home to hundreds of natural and exotic plant and animal species and is nestled near one of the nation's oldest and most intimate national parks.The 210-acre site that is now Garvan Woodland Gardens was purchased by Arthur B. Cook in 1920.  His daughter, Verna C. Garvan, began transforming 30 acres of the property into a garden by adding rare plants to the existing vegetation.  With Warren Bankson, she cut paths through the forest and continued adding new plants.  In 1985, she donated the entire site to the University of Arkansas Department of Landscape Architecture.  Public tours began in 1986.  A master plan was developed in 1995 and the Gardens have continued to develop since then.The Japanese sub-garden is known as the 'Garden of the Pine Wind'.  It was designed byDavid Slawsonand covers more than four acres It features a 'Full Moon Bridge', three cascades, a 12-foot waterfall, two springs, four pools and a pond of more than a half-acre in size. Slawson used existing landscapes as inspiration for this spectacular rock and stream garden.Garvan Woodland Gardens is a department of the University of Arkansas' School of Architecture.",

While today it is known for its lotus, water lilies and irises, originally, this was probably the main element of a much larger pond and hill garden on the estate of Miyamichi Iemasu, a member of the Heian aristocracy and connected through marriage to the powerful Fujiwara family.The temple was estroyed in 1470 during war and then later restored by the Tokugawa family and the Imperial Household.  Successive head priests have been drawn directly from the Imperial family.  Mito Mitsukuni (popularly known as Mito Komon) is said to have donated the stone lantern in front of the Shoin.The garden would originally have been used for boating and poem-writing parties, but today one can still stroll through the site.Take the Kyoto Subway Tozai Line: Ono Station - walk 6 minutesFree parking: 8 buses & 50 carsWheelchair accessible",

        "JGarden Description:": "What is now know as Komaba Koen, the largest ward-managed park in Tokyo, was originally the estate of Taisho and early Showa period diplomat and official, Marquis Maeda.  The Maeda family were the wealthy and powerful daimyo of the Kaga region during the Edo period.  (Kaga is now the region in which Kanazawa, famous for itsKenrokuengardens, is located).  Following the Meiji Restoration, the Maeda became senior members of the new national government.  The estate was built on the grounds of the Komaba Agricultural School with two homes were built: a large European-style one in 1929 and a large Japanese-style one in 1930.  Maeda lived in the European house.  The Japaense house was primarily used to entertain foreign guests, in particular those from England, where Maeda had served as a diplomat.  The garden on this site is located in the rear of the house, visible from both the living room and two bedrooms.  The garden consists of a narrow, grassy foreground, rising through boulders, a stream and dense trees as the eye moves toward the rear.Following Maeda's death in World War II, the estate was sold, but was snatched up GHQ duirng the Occupation, during which it served as a residence for senior members of the Occupation forces.  The national government purchased the site in 1958 and it was opened as a Tokyo city park in 1967.  Meguro Ward took over management of the park in 1957, and the original European house became the Tokyo Museum of Modern Literature shortly thereafter.  The first floor of the Japanese house is open to the public and the garden can be viewed from here, though this is not a tourist attraction and it appears to be used by the local community as much as anyone else.   Unlike many of the highly trafficked gardens in Kyoto and Tokyo, this garden and home retain the quiet atmosphere of a private residence.The house can be reached by taking the Inokashira subway line to Komaba-Todai-Mae station.  The park is a 10-15 minute walk about 1 kilometer to the NW.",

Its interest lies in its self-conscious representation of various Chinese sites.  In fact, the 30 year construction process included consultations with Zu Shu Shui, an exiled Chinese scholar.  The central pond has a horai-jima and is well stocked with koi.  The engetsukyo (Full Moon Bridge) is a stone bridge of Chinese design.  Like so many Japanese designs with foreign influences, though, this is really a Japanese garden with a nod to Chinese influences.  A yatsu-hashi bridge zig-zags through a field of irises.Sawaristepping stones pass near a waterfall and views unfold with a surprise around each corner.  Today the site has been reduced to 16 acres, but it is still well worth the visit.Koishikawa is an 8 minute walk from either JR Iidabashi Station or Korakuen Sation on the Marunouchi and Namboku lines.

According the local sotry, the spring saved the farmers in the region from an illness that was plaguing the area.  In 1440, lords of the Aizu province constructed retreats here.  Beginning in 1670 the Matsudaira family began to grow various medicinal plants and grasses and in the early 1700's, ginseng began to be cultivated.  It was at this time that the contemporary name became applied to the site.In 1953, the gardens were opened to the public.  Today, 400 different medicinal plants and trees are gorwn here.  The gardens are arranged around a central pond, lined by thick pines and shrubs.  Seasonal interest is provided by flowering cherry trees (sakura), peonies (botan), and lotuses (hasu).  Tea is offered on the site as well as a traditional meal ofkaiseki-ryori(reservations are required for the meal).Oyakuen is located northeast of Tsuruga-jo Castle, off Sengoku-dori, behind the York Benimaru.",

However, recent efforts have reduced this pollution.The Japanese garden is located within walking distance from the Cairo-Helwan railway station.

        "JGarden Description:": "At six acres in size, Yuko-en is one of the largest public Japanese gardens in the United States and the first such in Kentucky.  Japanese culture has a special significance to the local Bluegrass community as it is the site of a large Toyot Motor Company manufacturing plant.  The garden was built with donations from many local business and individuals including:  Toyota; the community of sister-city, Tahara-cho; Aichi Steel; Louisville Forge and Gear Works; and local financial institutions.  The entire project cost approximately $1 million.The garden has been built on the former site of a monastery built in 1898 on land acquired from the family of Gov. James F. Robinson.  The new garden was co-designed by Steve Austin, a local landscape architect and lawyer, and Jeff Singer, a local landscape designer and owner of Singer Gardens.The design process was not a conventional North American one.  Austin executed a series of paintings that outlined the vision of what the garden could become and then turned these over to nursery staff and construction workers, who actually did much of the design work as they were constructing the site.  This process is uncommon today, but is an important part of traditional Japanese design and has analogues in European architectural history as well.The originally flat field has been transformed by 600 truckloads of earth into a series of undulating hills that hide, reveal and frame views along the paths that guide visitors through the space.  Singer laid the dry creek bed by hand, placing each piece of gravela nd stone based on his experience as a river kayaking afficianado.  Other design elements include a bridge crossing the dry stream, a pond,tsukiyamapruned shrubs, stone lanterns and akaresansuidry garden.  An unusual addition is a bog garden adjacent to the pond.  The bog acts as a bio-filter for the pond.Planting and construction material are a combination of Japanese and local Kentucky sources.  Flowering red bud trees, join Kentucky canebrake and Bluegrass savanna, bur oaks, blue ash and Kentucky coffee trees.Phase 2 of the garden's design has already begun and will involve the construction of a viewing pavilion at the confluence of the pathways.The garden is located on Elkhorn Creek as part of the grounds of the Cardome Community Center on the west side of U.S. 25 (North Broadway).  The Community Center includes connections to 10 miles of public hiking trails as well as access to the Creek.",

These are interspersed with actual works of art from the museum\u2019s collection, giving the visitor an integrated experience of the art, buildings and landscape.The museum was established in 1970 to exhibit the private collection of Adachi Zenyasu, and includes some 1,300 modern paintings by artists such as Yokoyama Taikan and Sakakibara Shiho, as well as ceramic works by Kawai Kanjiro and Kitaoji Rosanjin, wood sculpture and gold lacquer ware.The four main gardens represent several styles and are known as The Dry Landscape Garden (featuring 800 red pine trees brought from the Noto Peninsula), The White Gravel and Pine Garden, The Moss Garden and The Pond Garden (with teahouse).  Another garden features a reproduction of the Shokin-tei from Kyoto\u2019s famous Katsura Imperial Villa.The classically-shaped and intensively-prunedtamamonoshrubs and pine trees will inspire envy in any gardener.  The immaculate grounds and crisp, picture-perfect scenes create an almost surreal atmosphere, sometimes evoking the clean outlines and detail of a woodblock print.BibliographyAdachi Museum of Art.Gardens of the Adachi Museum of Art.

'garden of confluent waters') is part of the larger 'Gardens of the World' project that includes a Chinese garden, a Balinese garden and an oriental garden. A Korean garden is under construction and will be completed in 2005.The garden combines many different styles and elements in japanese landscape architecture:yarimizuor stream style-garden,karesansui, a rather wide field of lawn and stepping stones are all worthy of note.As one enters the gate, the path immediately veers right and a staircase leads up a hill. Since there are hedges and bushes on both sides of the way, you cannot catch a glimpse of the garden until having almost reached the top of the hill. (This technique of hiding the garden reminds of the upper villa\r\nofShugakuin Rikyuin Kyoto and is used twice within Yuusui-en: At the beginning of the course and also before turning back and entering the pavillion.)  From the top of the hill, you have a wonderful overview over the whole garden: the dry waterfall inkaresansuistyle, the murmuring creek with real water and the pavillion 'Nyosui-tei' where both waters meet. The creek symbolizes the flow of time from the beginning of German history, ending in a tiny pond which reflects the recent history. The dry waterfall symbolizes the future. The pavillion is located in the present - the center of both waters, between past and future. The stone arrangement in the middle of the karesansui-style pond is a symbol for a carp, showing strenght and perseverance in swimming against the stream.Take the U-Bahn Marzahn S7.

Reservations are required for the tea ceremonies and are accepted at the front desk in the Eliot House lobby one-week prior to the ceremony.  Groups and classes may arrange for special tours by calling the Eliot House office. Meditation instruction is offered.

The story begins with Nomura Denbei, a samurai at the end of the Edo period, who, when he was cut off from his stipend with the Meiji Restoration, attempted to cultivate apple orchards on his 3,300 sq meter estate in the Nagamachi section of town.  For a while, Kagaringo(apple) were very popular in Tokyo, and the business flourished.  But when apple production shifted to Tohoku (northern Japan), Nomura was forced to sell off his land.  The last section was purchased by a local industrialist in the early Showa period.  The new owner moved an old house here from Daishoji-cho and constructed an Enshu-style garden and tea house.The name, Onikawa, is derived from they\u00f4suiwaterway running from the house and through the garden.  Whileoniis now written with the character for 'demon', it originally was written with the character for 'luggage' or 'baggage' and probably indicated the use of the river for mvoing supplies from the sea to the castle.",

A Shinto shrine was added in 1927 and a 23-story stone pagoda, a gift from the City of Nagoya, was erected in 1938.  The garden was damaged in World War II. It was rehabilitated and enlarged in 1967 for the German Garden Exhibition held in Karlsruhe that year.  Ownership of the garden was transferred in 1994 by the German-Japanese Society of Karlsruhe.  Since then, the group has planted several cherry trees and camelias.  The garden continues to be maintained by the City's garden office (Gartenbauamt, Lammstr.13)You enter the garden through a red Tori, wander along a small river to a pond, where you can have a rest in a little pavilion next to the source which feeds the pond. At the far end of the garden you find a Shinto shrine guarded by tokoma-inu(lion-dogs).  Across a footpath at the bank of the Stadtgarten-lake there is a kare san sui stone garden.

The garden was built on the land allotments of the Edo Period discovered during archaelogical excavations.  The name 'Koko-en' is derived from 'Koko do' the name of Japan's sixth provincial school founded in 1692 in Himeji by the last Lord of Himeji, Lord Sakai.     The garden includes the Oyashiki-no-niwa (lit. 'Garden of the Feudal Load's Residence'), the 'Cha-no-niwa' (Tea Garden) and seven other gardens as well as a decent restaurant too. If you're going to Himeji Castle, you should certainly visit these gardens as well.The garden is located next to Himeji Castle, just a short walk (15 min) from the Shinkansen station in Himeji or a 5 min bus ride to the Koko-en bus stop.Himeji is a city of 460,000, located in southwestern Hyogo Prefecture.  It is most famous for its castle, a national treasure that was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1993.  Himeji became a sister city of Phoenix in 1976, when an agreement was formally signed by the mayors of both cities in Phoenix.",

In 633 B.C., the Suddhodana queen, Mahamaya gave birth to a child on the way from the capital of Kapilavastu to her parents' home.  That child was Gautama Buddha and the location was known as Lumbini. Lumbini is now a large Buddhist temple complex comprised of New Lumbini Village, monasteries and temples, and a sacred forest.  There is a Nepalese temple near the entrance.  The Japanese garden is supposed to be nearby and it encloses a Tibetan temple.",

The garden features a 500-year-old stone lantern given to the College by alum Eiro Yamashita; a small fountain; a stone path; boulders taken from the woods of nearby Shelburne and Conway; and a sophisticated planting design that is designed to flourish with regular pruning and maintenance.The champion behind creation of the garden is Ray A.

It is said to have been originally built in the time of Empress Suiko, as a protection for ship sailing to Korea for trade and cultural contact.Gardens are not usually associated with shrines, but Shigemori pioneered this genre.  The garden has strong reference to the sea.  Concrete lines meander across sand and stone, lined with tiny outcroppings of moss and ground cover.  The stones are arranged in Horai style, referring to the gods of the sea.  Similar to Kasuga, the stone arrangements are in  3/5/7 groupings (numbers traditionally assocated with Shinto).  The waving concrete lines become more wavy as they approach the 'shore'.  A bamboo fence on one side completed the scene, but it has been replaced with something simpler and can only be appreciated in books at this point.Transport: Approximately 200m south of the 'Shikanjima 2-chome' City Bus Stop",

There are four gods  that protect the four heavenly directions.  The garden is broken into four offset quadrants (to eliminate a sense of symmetry) corresponding to 4 Chinese gods of directions: Red Phoenix (South-fire), Blue Dragon (East-wood), White Tiger (West-metal), Black Tortoise (North-water) [note that these are the same symbols used in Feng Shui. ed.]  The sand in each quadrant shifts color: black, pale blue, white and reddish sand (from Kurama).  Shigemori stated that the four animals are intended to be chasing each other in a counter-clockwise circle of life in front of the Hojo.  The sand is raked so that the turbulence of the water indicates the direction of the flow.  Usually Shigemori encouraged his clients to come up with their own raking patterns, so it is unclear if the current patterns are his or the temples.  Similar to his other work, Shigemori used the bamboo fence as a way to mark the site by placeing the characters for \u2018four gods\u2019 written in bamboo.  Many Japanese criticize this as too direct, but Tschumi points out that for Shigemori, a painter, the fence was simply acting as another canvas.  Actual installation was probably done in 3-4 weeks.  The garden is open to the public during daylight hours.Transport:  From JR Hukuchi-yama line, Tanba Takeda Station, go NE 1.4 km.",

        "JGarden Description:": "The Museum of East Asian Art in Cologne houses Chinese, Korean and Japanese art. It was founded in 1913 and was the first museum of its kind in Germany. The core of the permanent collection is the Japanese collection of the founder of the museum Adolf Fischer (1857-1914) and his wife Frieda Bartdorff (1874-1945). Their collection which includes Buddhist painting and wood sculpture, Japanese screen painting, colour wood prints and lacquer work is regarded as one of the most important collections in Europe. Other focal points of the permanent collection are religious bronze objects from China, and Chinese, Korean and Japanese ceramics, above all Korean celadon objects of the Koryo dynasty from the 10th to the 14th century with their unique glaze. The museum\u2019s collection of lacquer work and screens are also of international standing.The museum building was opened in 1977 and underlines the cultural importance of the collection. It was designed by Kunio Maekawa (1905-1986) who was a pupil of Le Corbusier. Its severe, transparently structured cubes take up old Japanese traditions and at the same time develop a new and modern iconography. The complex is centered round a landscaped garden in the tradition of Japanese gardens of meditation created by the Japanese sculptor Masayuke Nagare (born 1923). This symbiosis of Japanese architecture and garden design together with the presentation of oriental art gives this Cologne museum a well-defined, unmistakable identity. In keeping with the concept of the founder of the museum, Adolf Fischer, the exhibits are not presented as documents of cultural history but as autonomous works of art which illustrate specific styles of a period or individual artist. Fischer\u2019s open approach eschewing pre-conceived notions has since been confirmed again and again by research in the field of oriental art history. Although the exhibition area has been expanded, a large proportion of the collection cannot be exhibited and so the presentation is changed several times a year. In addition, there are regular themed exhibitions with exhibits from the permanent collection.German language site:http://www.museenkoeln.de/museum-fuer-ostasiatische-kunst/Accessible by subway/tram from Universit\u00e4tsstra\u00dfe.",
